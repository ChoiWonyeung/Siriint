This enables a quick configuration to your needs or an easy exchangability for another handling application. The large and flow optimized air channels allow high speed pick place applications with a gripping time less then 50 ms. Additionally the arrays can be separately used with plates or profiles to get a very flexible handling system or an EOAT integration. Besides these three standard arrays, also customized arrays with a different number of fingers or another distance between the fingers are available. \n• Fits to all SoftGripping Bases, Plates and Profils \n• Change the fingers without any tools \n• High speed pick and place applications \n• Custom arrays available (number of fingers and finger distance)']","{'Payload': '1.6kg', 'Reach': ' --', 'Axis': ' --', 'Weight': ' 0.46kg', 'Repeatability': ' --', 'Speed': ' --'}","['Price:\n£££', 'Shipped from: DE']","{'0': 'https://bot-hive.com/product/softgripping-construction-kit-12-combination-options-4', '1': 'https://bot-hive.com/product/softgripping-four-finger-centric-softgripper-75-cone-angle', '2': 'https://bot-hive.com/product/softgripping-four-finger-parallel-softgripper-75-cone-angle', '3': 'https://bot-hive.com/product/softgripping-finger-parallel-softgripper-75-cone-angle'}"

Humans and robots must work together like a team and not like competitors. Robots should work for the benefit of humans, to spare us tedious tasks and eliminate safety constraints. Eliminating barriers in everyday work, helping humans maintain full control over operations, and adding value to human work within companies, no matter their size or business, that is Stäubli’s philosophy.

It makes it easy to program typical task and pick & place tasks by using a tablet. The collaborative robot COBOTTA has been developed as an open-source platform and thus can be integrated into existing systems. \nCOBOTTA is particularly well suited for operating in small spaces and in direct collaboration with humans. A special focus was placed on safety: The cobot features an inherently safe design (lightweight arm without sharp edges or pinch points, minimal possible task of force and pressure thanks to adequately developed drive technology) and guarantees a “functional safety” by constantly monitoring torque and speeds of all axes.\nThanks to the fully integrated, built-in electrical gripper and a built-in A/F camera in the robot arm, combined with the standard programming Apps, users can easily create force-controlled gripper task as well as other task in just a few minutes. This also enables 2D image recognition. The collaborative robot COBOTTA is availabale with various options, such as vacuum gripper (the vacuum is generated directly at the end effector) and a fieldbus adaptor (ProfiNet, EtherCAT, Ethernet IP).
