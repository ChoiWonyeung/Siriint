			"Product Description\nCobot grippers must be lightweight, easy to operate and  have no sharp edges. The flexible SoftGripping fingers in combination with the fully integrated SoftGripping Cobot bases are ideal to meet all these requirements. Depending on your gripping objects you can choose between centric or parallel SoftGripper. The number of fingers you need depends on the weight of your objects. Different sized objects can be covered by different cone angles of the fingers. You can chose between 60°, 75° and 90°. You will be surprised how safe and easy one SoftGripper can handle a broad range of objects due to its flexibility, there is no need of different gripper for different shaped objects. The fingers can be easliy mounted at the gripper base with a bayonet joint without any tools. Additionally a vacuum suction cup can be mounted centrically. These models require a compressor to grip. A vacuum system isn't needed, but can perform the full opening of the grippers. If you have special requests or uncommon sizes, we can design an individual SoftGripper perfect for your needs within two weeks."

In addition, the robot’s weight has been kept to a minimum (900 kg) to avoid compacting the soil. When used frequently, it allows to regularly maintain the vineyard.  \nTED is the first entirely autonomous electric robot on the market to efficiently maintain and weed vine rows with a high level of precision. Naïo Technologies started marketing TED in 2017. Today, some 15 TED robots are maintaining the vineyards of our customers and partners."

The benefits of robots in industry are no longer in doubt: every year, robots join new sectors, and their “population” is growing around the world. As they become smarter and perform better, they are finding a place in production alongside humans. \nBut what exactly is that place? And what is the vision behind their work? Humans and robots must work together like a team and not like competitors. Robots should work for the benefit of humans, to spare us tedious tasks and eliminate safety constraints. Eliminating barriers in everyday work, helping humans maintain full control over operations, and adding value to human work within companies, no matter their size or business, that is Stäubli’s philosophy. Today, these pioneering TX2 six-axis collaborative robots with their CS9 controller meet all of these expectations. "

A 3168mm vertical stroke and maximum reach of 3210mm easily allows a single LP robot to load up to 6 pallets and multiple conveyors in a layout with ±180º operation of the J1-axis.  High speed servo control system allows up to 1800 palletizing cycles per hour with 60Kg payload or 1500 cycles per hour with 130Kg payload.  Advanced yet easy to use palletizing software intuitively guides the user through teaching new palletizing routines.  Path optimization software features aid the programmer in minimizing cycle time and increasing product throughput.  Automatic program path generation minimizes setup and teaching time by automatically creating a robot motion path from cell layout input data.  After teaching, the Nachi “Part Height Adjustment” software function automatically compensates for real world conditions and eliminates the need for constant program “touchup”."

			"Product Description\nCobot grippers must be lightweight, easy to operate and  have no sharp edges. The flexible SoftGripping fingers in combination with the fully integrated SoftGripping Cobot bases are ideal to meet all these requirements. Depending on your gripping objects you can choose between centric or parallel SoftGripper. The number of fingers you need depends on the weight of your objects. Different sized objects can be covered by different cone angles of the fingers. You can chose between 60°, 75° and 90°. You will be surprised how safe and easy one SoftGripper can handle a broad range of objects due to its flexibility, there is no need of different gripper for different shaped objects. The fingers can be easliy mounted at the gripper base with a bayonet joint without any tools. Additionally a vacuum suction cup can be mounted centrically. These models require a compressor to grip. A vacuum system isn't needed, but can perform the full opening of the grippers. If you have special requests or uncommon sizes, we can design an individual SoftGripper perfect for your needs within two weeks."

			"Product Description\nCobot grippers must be lightweight, easy to operate and  have no sharp edges. The flexible SoftGripping fingers in combination with the fully integrated SoftGripping Cobot bases are ideal to meet all these requirements. \nDepending on your gripping objects you can choose between centric or parallel SoftGripper. The number of fingers you need depends on the weight of your objects. Different sized objects can be covered by different cone angles of the fingers. You can chose between 60°, 75° and 90°. You will be surprised how safe and easy one SoftGripper can handle a broad range of objects due to its flexibility, there is no need of different gripper for different shaped objects. The fingers can be easily mounted at the gripper base with a bayonet joint without any tools. Additionally a vacuum suction cup can be mounted centrically. \nThese models require a compressor to grip. A vacuum system isn't needed, but can perform the full opening of the grippers. If you have special requests or uncommon sizes, we can design an individual SoftGripper perfect for your needs within two weeks."

			"Product Description\nThe modular Industrial SoftGripper consist of the fingers, different gripper arrays and bases. The fingers are connected to the arrays with the bayonet joint and can be changed quickly without any tools. The arrays with 1, 2 or 4 fingers can be connected to any SoftGripper base. This enables a quick configuration to your needs or an easy exchangability for another handling application. The large and flow optimized air channels allow high speed pick place applications with a gripping time less then 50 ms. Additionally the arrays can be separately used with plates or profiles to get a very flexible handling system or an EOAT integration. Besides these three standard arrays, also customized arrays with a different number of fingers or another distance between the fingers are available.\n• Fits to all SoftGripping Bases, Plates and Profils \n• Change the fingers without any tools \n• High speed pick and place applications \n• Custom arrays available (number of fingers and finger distance)"

Strong and fast industrial cobot with a reach of 850 mm and a payload of 10 kg. Simple programming thanks to our special intuitive Kassow user interface. Kassow Robots move at speeds up to 225 degrees per second on all 7 axes. Higher robot speeds increase production output significantly and therefore broaden the range of tasks that can be carried out. Despite their aluminium construction, the Kassow robots have a payload of up to 10 kg without compromising on speed. A higher payload increases the range of objects that can be handled (scope) while still providing high production speeds,"

A 3168mm vertical stroke and maximum reach of 3210mm easily allows a single LP robot to load up to 6 pallets and multiple conveyors in a layout with ±180º operation of the J1-axis.  High speed servo control system allows up to 1800 palletizing cycles per hour with 60Kg payload or 1500 cycles per hour with 130Kg payload.  Advanced yet easy to use palletizing software intuitively guides the user through teaching new palletizing routines.  Path optimization software features aid the programmer in minimizing cycle time and increasing product throughput.  Automatic program path generation minimizes setup and teaching time by automatically creating a robot motion path from cell layout input data.  After teaching, the Nachi “Part Height Adjustment” software function automatically compensates for real world conditions and eliminates the need for constant program “touchup”."

It makes it easy to program typical task and pick & place tasks by using a tablet. The collaborative robot COBOTTA has been developed as an open-source platform and thus can be integrated into existing systems. \nCOBOTTA is particularly well suited for operating in small spaces and in direct collaboration with humans. A special focus was placed on safety: The cobot features an inherently safe design (lightweight arm without sharp edges or pinch points, minimal possible task of force and pressure thanks to adequately developed drive technology) and guarantees a “functional safety” by constantly monitoring torque and speeds of all axes.\nThanks to the fully integrated, built-in electrical gripper and a built-in A/F camera in the robot arm, combined with the standard programming Apps, users can easily create force-controlled gripper task as well as other task in just a few minutes. This also enables 2D image recognition. The collaborative robot COBOTTA is availabale with various options, such as vacuum gripper (the vacuum is generated directly at the end effector) and a fieldbus adaptor (ProfiNet, EtherCAT, Ethernet IP).

The benefits of robots in industry are no longer in doubt: every year, robots join new sectors, and their “population” is growing around the world. As they become smarter and perform better, they are finding a place in production alongside humans. \nBut what exactly is that place? And what is the vision behind their work? Humans and robots must work together like a team and not like competitors. Robots should work for the benefit of humans, to spare us tedious tasks and eliminate safety constraints. Eliminating barriers in everyday work, helping humans maintain full control over operations, and adding value to human work within companies, no matter their size or business, that is Stäubli’s philosophy. Today, these pioneering TX2 six-axis collaborative robots with their CS9 controller meet all of these expectations."

A 3168mm vertical stroke and maximum reach of 3210mm easily allows a single LP robot to load up to 6 pallets and multiple conveyors in a layout with ±180º operation of the J1-axis.  High speed servo control system allows up to 1800 palletizing cycles per hour with 60Kg payload or 1500 cycles per hour with 130Kg payload.  Advanced yet easy to use palletizing software intuitively guides the user through teaching new palletizing routines.  Path optimization software features aid the programmer in minimizing cycle time and increasing product throughput.  Automatic program path generation minimizes setup and teaching time by automatically creating a robot motion path from cell layout input data.  After teaching, the Nachi “Part Height Adjustment” software function automatically compensates for real world conditions and eliminates the need for constant program “touchup”."

A 3168mm vertical stroke and maximum reach of 3210mm easily allows a single LP robot to load up to 6 pallets and multiple conveyors in a layout with ±180º operation of the J1-axis.  High speed servo control system allows up to 1800 palletizing cycles per hour with 60Kg payload or 1500 cycles per hour with 130Kg payload.  Advanced yet easy to use palletizing software intuitively guides the user through teaching new palletizing routines.  Path optimization software features aid the programmer in minimizing cycle time and increasing product throughput.  Automatic program path generation minimizes setup and teaching time by automatically creating a robot motion path from cell layout input data.  After teaching, the Nachi “Part Height Adjustment” software function automatically compensates for real world conditions and eliminates the need for constant program “touchup”."
