In this world, robots would execute all strenuous tasks, enabling humans to dedicate their precious time to lighter, more skilled or demanding tasks.With FANUC collaborative robots, that world has already come into existence. By integrating them into existing production environments, robots directly collaborate with humans, becoming a crucial part of the team. Alongside humans, they take over tedious, repetitive tasks, lifting up to 35 kg, thus maintaining the human’s health while automating entire assembly lines."

			"Product DescriptionThe KR QUANTEC ultra is the most powerful, stiff and precise robot in the KR QUANTEC series. It offers maximum power in every position and is as dynamic, streamlined and efficient as the other family members. The KR QUANTEC ultra is also the ultimate in high-performance shelf-mounted robots.With its payload capacity of 300 kilograms and a maximum reach of 3,100 millimeters, the KR QUANTEC ultra is the strongest, most compact industrial robot. As such, the KR QUANTEC ultra has the highest power density currently available in the high payload range for the manufacturing industry. Furthermore, you can choose from various mounting positions and versions – such as the Foundry variants for areas with a high level of contamination, high humidity and high temperatures. Six shelf-mounted variants are also available."
