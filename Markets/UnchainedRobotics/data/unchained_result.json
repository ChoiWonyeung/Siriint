With maximum payloads of up to 18 kilograms and maximum reaches of up to 1800 millimeters, Kassow Robots’ cobots are powerful, fast and suitable for use in small spaces due to their maneuverability. They also enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement both simple and complex automation flexibly, independently and cost-effectively.Kassow’s technology is built around their robots’ extraordinarily strong joints. Not only are the joints robust, but they also enable lateral movements thanks to their 7th axis and optimally reproduce the motor function of human arms. This innovation was combined with simple, intuitive programming and operation based on well-known standard tablet technology.These innovative cobots were developed by a team led by Kassow Robots founder and CEO Kristian Kassow, who has already made a significant mark on the industry with his past contributions to the robotics industry.6 axes good, 7 axes better Most modern robot arms have only six axes (or degrees of freedom). The Cobot KR810 from Kassow Robots, unlike most other manufacturers, offers a 7th axis - and that in combination with unique efficiency. These 7 fully controlled axes allow for significantly more flexibility, because the robot arms can replicate the motor activity of real human arms much better and can even reach around corners. The result: more flexibility in movements. A robot with curves Thanks to their special kinematics, Kassow Robots' cobots can easily follow a given path – moving not only in straight lines, but also in curves - constantly and at a given speed.  This allows the cobot to be used for welding, gluing and more tasks that require a non-linear application at constant speed without settling. A truly collaborative robot The Kassow KR810 is a lightweight collaborative robot (cobot). It is designed to work with humans in an industrial environment. After a risk analysis, the robot can work with no or limited safety restrictions, which allows it to work with or collaborate with other employees. Innovative Software Interface The Kassow KR810 cobot is easy to operate and program, even small businesses and medium-sized companies can do this independently.  In addition, intelligent features such as a data Ethernet connection have been built into the cobots.",

Its small footprint is great for bench-tops or built directly inside machinery, making it well suited for light assembly and screwdriving applications. These unique features make the UR3e-Cobot the most flexible and lightest collaborative benchtop robot currently on the market. The UR3e collaborative robot is an ideal assistant for applications that require consistent product quality, such as assembly, polishing, gluing, and bolting. The UR3e can also be mounted on a tabletop and used at a separate workstation, where it picks up, assembles and places parts in optimized manufacturing processes. Its compact design and easy programming make it easy to switch between tasks to meet agile manufacturing needs, resulting in a low total cost of ownership and very fast payback time. UR3e robotic applications include manufacturing industries from medical devices to printed circuit boards and electronic components. Easy programming Patented technology lets operators with no programming experience quickly set up and operate our cobots with intuitive, 3D visualization. Simply move the robot arm to desired waypoints or touch the arrow keys on the easy-to-use touchscreen tablet. Fast setup Universal Robots has revolutionized cobot set-up, reducing typical robotic deployment measured in weeks to a matter of hours. The average set-up time reported by our customers is only half a day. The out-of-box experience for an untrained operator to unpack the cobot, mount it, and program the first simple task is typically less than an hour. Flexible use Don’t be limited by dedicated robotics. Universal Robots are lightweight, space-saving, and easy to re-deploy to multiple applications without changing your production layout. Moving the cobot to new processes is fast and easy, giving you the agility to automate almost any manual task, including those with small batches or fast changeovers. The cobot is able to re-use programs for recurrent tasks. Collaborative and secure Now you can replace human operators in dirty, dangerous, and dull jobs to reduce repetitive strain and accidental injuries.

These modern cobots are flexible and adapt easily to new processes as they arise. AUBO’s i-Series cobots are lightweight and powerful, so they can be moved and reconfigured for new processes quickly and easily.AUBO robots have a small footprint but are a large impact on production costs. AUBO Robotics helps companies gain a competitive advantage in the manufacturing environment while freeing employees from dangerous and repetitive tasks.A truly collaborative experience The i16 Cobot is adaptable and designed to be easily repurposed from one task to another. The operator can teach the robot by guiding it manually (inverse kinematic motion planning). This allows operators without programming skills to teach the cobot new actions and tasks. It can also be taught new processes via a teach pendant interface (forward kinematics). Open-source architecture The i16 Cobot is not only easy to teach and program, but also open and expandable. A CAN bus network is used in this robot, which allows multiple microcontrollers to communicate with each other. In addition, compatibility with ROS (Robot Operating System) is supported through an API. Finally, the hardware uses BUS protocols with open I/O interface extensions. Built with safety in mind The AUBO i16 is designed to work safely in collaboration with its human counterparts. The following safety features are built into the i16: Safety-monitored stop, speed and separation monitoring, manual guidance, and force limitation. A high price-performance ratio Between its ease of integration and the fact that even non-programmers can teach it new processes, the AUBO i16 offers an attractive return on investment. In addition, its lightweight design and small footprint make it easy to deploy from one station and process to another.",

The depth camera offers a wide field of view for depth and RGB sensors and features an industrial M12 Ethernet conenction and an M8 power connector. Its waterproof and dustproof housing is optimized for industrial environments. The FRAMOS Industrial Depth Camera D435e is ideal for OEMs and integrators who require both 3D and 2D vision in their products and applications. The global shutter of the depth sensors enables applications with fast motion, while the D415e with rolling shutter sensors offers higher accuracy through a higher baseline. The FRAMOS Industrial Depth Camera D435e works with a modified version of the Cross-Platform SDK for Intel® RealSense™ devices.The D435e starter kit includes the camera itself, an M12-to-RJ45 Ethernet cable, and an M8 power cable with wall plug. It comes fully equipped so you can quickly start and test the camera.   Intel® RealSense™ SDK The FRAMOS version of the Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0 provides almost all functionalities of the original for the D400e cameras and allows the use of already existing codes/applications written for the USB variant. In addition, the FRAMOS SDK version allows you to run D400e cameras in parallel with USB variants.   Industrial protection class IP66 dust and waterproof Thanks to the D435e's rugged construction, it can perform well even in suboptimal conditions. In particular, the camera can operate in wet and dusty conditions where many other cameras would fail. This more rugged housing allows for increased uptime and a wide range of potential applications. This camera is also available in IP67 on a project basis.   Long cable, lots of freedom With cable lengths of up to 100 m, the D435e offers users a great deal of freedom in positioning, solving a challenge of USB cameras that are limited by short cable lengths. The camera can also be operated via the lockable, industrial-grade M12 Ethernet connector using Power over Ethernet (PoE) with just one cable for data exchange and power supply. Alternatively, a dedicated power supply is possible via the lockable, industrial-grade M8 connector and a GPIO contact is available for external synchronization or triggering of the camera.",

Double the gripper, double the productivity Some processes can be greatly accelerated through the use two grippers on a single arm. Other processes can only be achieved with a double gripper setup. This is not a problem with Hanwha's HCR Advanced series. The robot has 2 I/O ports with 8 pins for direct integration of dual grippers. Inuitive User Interface Hanwha Robotics has designed the HCR interface to be as simple and user-friendly as possible. It enables simple and direct control of the robot. Thanks to this inuitive and user-friendly setup, operators can be trained in just one day!",

The depth camera offers a field of view of approximately 72° (diagonal) for depth and RGB sensors. Further, the D415e features an industrial M12 Ethernet connection and an M8 power connector. Its waterproof and dustproof housing is optimized for industrial environments. The D415e is ideal for OEMs and integrators who require both 3D and 2D vision in their products and applications. The 55mm baseline rolling shutter depth sensors provide increased depth accuracy for applications requiring high precision compared to the D435e’s 50mm baseline global shutter sensors. The FRAMOS Industrial Depth Camera D415e works with a modified version of the Cross-Platform SDK for Intel® RealSense™ devices.   Intel® RealSense™ SDK The FRAMOS version of the Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0 provides almost all functionalities of the original for the D400e cameras and allows the use of already existing codes/applications written for the USB variant. In addition, the FRAMOS SDK version allows you to run D400e cameras in parallel with USB variants.   Industrial protection class IP66 dust and waterproof Thanks to the FRAMOS D415e's rugged design, it can perform well even in suboptimal conditions. In particular, the camera can operate in wet and dusty conditions where many other cameras would fail. This more rugged housing allows for increased uptime and a wide range of potential applications. This camera is also available in IP67 on a project basis.   Long cable, lots of freedom With cable lengths of up to 100 m, the D415e camera offers users a great deal of freedom in positioning, solving a challenge of USB cameras that are limited by short cable lengths. The camera can also be operated via the lockable, industrial-grade M12 Ethernet connector using Power over Ethernet (PoE) with only one cable for data exchange and power supply. Alternatively, a dedicated power supply is possible via the lockable, industrial-grade M8 connector and a GPIO contact is available for external synchronization or triggering of the camera.",

			"Text": "FeaturesStacking packages by hand was yesterday – here comes the ibk CobotPalletizer!To automate a palletizing does not have to be complicated and expensive. The CobotPalletizer from ibk is the fast and easy way to automate palletizing in your production. Ibk has been making cobot-based starter kits for years and has used that experience to develop the CobotPalletizer. This all-in-one palletizing solution is designed to completely take over the palletizing needs at the end of a production line. The CobotPalletizer is a so-called double palletizer, as it can work with pallets on both sides to further speed up production. When one pallet is finished, the system does not have to wait for it to be taken away, but can instead start with pallet number two. This allows production to continue unhindered.At the heart of the cobot palletizer is a KR1410 cobot from Kassow Robots. These cobots are unique in that they have 7 axes rather than the 6 axes typical of cobots. This allows for more graceful, dexterous, and human-like movements. This increased flexibility makes the CobotPalletizer a more capable palletizing platform.The CobotPalletizer is designed to be easy to operate, maintain and service. The control panel is located behind the unit for easy control, even when pallets are placed on either side. Power and control devices are located inside the station to protect them, but are also easily accessible for maintenance tasks.The palletizing software is easy to use and robot operators can be trained quickly and inexpensively. The Cobot palletizer was also designed to take up as little floor space as possible. While it is a powerful solution, it does not take up much valuable floor space.The CobotPalletizer is available in three versions: without a gripper, with a Schmalz FXCB (area vacuum) and with an OnRobot VGP20. Read below to discover the different strengths of these two grippers!Robot.Due to the innovative 7-axis kinematics of the Kassow robot KR1410, no additional lifting unit (Z-axis) is needed – for you this means: Cost savings with higher process reliability at the same time!.Technical dataBase area: 1800x2050mm (with adjusted pallets)Palletizing capacity: up to 3.5 packages/minute or up to 200 packages/hourPayload of the total system: 9.0kg (=load KR1410 minus Airskin SafetyFlange), without tools2x pallet spaces up to max. 1200x800mm (EPAL)Palletizing height up to 2250mm from floorSafely reduced robot speedConnection cable with a length of 5m and Schuko plug (230V)Scope of deliveryPalletizingModule:Base for cobot pick-up with 4 integrated sensors (2×2) to detect the correct pallet positionSimple control panel for ongoing operationOptical status displays per pallet positionAcoustic signal generator in case of unexpected start-upDrawer to hold the robot controller and holder for the control panelPrepared connectors (M12) for packet sensingTechnologyCobot Kassow KR1410; rated payload: 10 kgAirskin SafetyFlange and adapter; 1 kgOptional Grippers:Schmalz FXCB (surface suction cup); external compressed air required; mass 2kg; payload CobotPalletizer = 7kgOnRobot VGP20; electric vacuum generation; no external compressed air required; mass 2.6kg; payload cobot palletizer = 6.4kgMany other compatible gripping devices available   Simple to use User-friendly programming, without much effort and special IT knowledge   Flexible Adapts quickly to production changes   Advanced With or without external compressed air   Precise Robust stops and sensors enable high positioning accuracy   Productive Uninterrupted operation thanks to two pallet positions   Customized Optional selection of suitable vacuum grippers   Practical Holder for the mobile control panel and drawer for the robot controller   Secure Airskin technology, visual status indicators and acoustic warning signal in case of unexpected start-up",

			"Text": "FeaturesWith their growing capabilities and increasing ease of use, robots represent the beginning of a new era of ubiquitous “helpers”. Robotics will be the leading technology of a whole new generation of autonomous devices and vehicles. State-of–the-art-technologies such as ultrasound, laser scanner, or radar are still used because of their proven reliability. Camera systems have become indispensable as an optical interface between the physical and digital world. This is because the goal of greater autonomy for robots can only be achieved if the digital image of reality is as detailed as possible. The 3D cameras check products for quality, recognize sought-after objects, or detect obstacles without time-consuming scanning.    Reliable volume determination for storage and conveyor technology Constantly increasing freight volumes require more efficient solutions in logistics and intralogistics. If the last centimeter is crucial in storage space and transport planning, the 3D sensor can determine the current volume or the correct position of the freight in milliseconds.   Contactless measurement of cuboid objects, e.g., cartons or packages Camera systems have become indispensable as an optical interface between the physical and digital worlds. After all, the goal of greater autonomy for robots can only be achieved if the digital image of reality is as detailed and accurate as possible. The 3D cameras check products for quality, recognize sought-after objects or detect obstacles without time-consuming scanning.   Reliable measurement of height, width and length to calculate girth and volume Above all, automation in the packaging industry must be flexible. A multitude of different products, outer packaging, and containers are produced and should reach the customer completely and undamaged. The use of many individual sensors is often reliable, but product changes take time and are a source of error. The use of a sensor that performs many tasks simultaneously is much more sensible.",

			"Text": "FeaturesThe FHV7 Smart Camera is an all-in-one camera with the functionalities of the high-spec vision system FH Series packed in its compact, robust body that is easy to deploy.It provides almost all inspection and measurement functions of the FH Series, and allows for easier image inspections of matching quality, even in processes where inspection had previously been omitted due to restrictions in durability, space, and system deployment time.   High-speed processing The all-in-one FHV7 Smart Camera is packed with capabilities garnered through the FH Series.Its high performance, comparable to a dedicated image processing system, supports advanced applications as well.   Autofocus Lens The autofocus lens covers a focal length range from 59 mm to 2,000 mm. Even when products in different sizes are produced, the focus range can be changed easily by parameters. This feature eliminates mechanical operation for changeover during product replacement, leading to a simpler system with higher productivity.   Accommodates color variations Multi-color light provides a quick solution to the issue of measuring different colors. For example, objects with variously colored packages on a production line are properly measured with the light that changes its illumination color to fit each object. When the product design is changed or a new models is added, you can simply change a parameter instead of replacing or  fine-tuning lights. The production line is always ready for a wider variety of product.",

With maximum payloads of up to 18 kilograms and maximum reaches of up to 1800 millimeters, Kassow Robots’ cobots are powerful, fast and suitable for use in small spaces due to their maneuverability. They also enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement both simple and complex automation flexibly, independently and cost-effectively.Kassow’s technology is built around their robots’ extraordinarily strong joints. Not only are the joints robust, but they also enable lateral movements thanks to their 7th axis and optimally reproduce the motor function of human arms. This innovation was combined with simple, intuitive programming and operation based on well-known standard tablet technology.These innovative cobots were developed by a team led by Kassow Robots founder and CEO Kristian Kassow, who has already made a significant mark on the industry with his past contributions to the robotics industry.With a payload of 18 kg, the KR1018 is the most powerful collaborative robot from Kassow Robots.6 axes good, 7 axes better Most modern robot arms have only six axes (or degrees of freedom). The Cobot KR1018 from Kassow Robots, unlike most other manufacturers, offers a 7th axis - and that in combination with unique efficiency. These 7 fully controlled axes allow for significantly more flexibility, because the robot arms can replicate the motor activity of real human arms much better and can even reach around corners. The result: more flexibility in movements. A robot with curves Thanks to their special kinematics, Kassow Robots' cobots can easily follow a given path – moving not only in straight lines, but also in curves - constantly and at a given speed.  This allows the cobot to be used for welding, gluing and more tasks that require a non-linear application at constant speed without settling. A truly collaborative robot The Kassow KR1018 cobot is easy to operate and program, even small businesses and medium-sized companies can do this independently.  In addition, intelligent features such as a data Ethernet connection have been built into the cobots.

			"Text": "SpecificationsThe KR1205 is the all-rounder of the KR series of cobots from Kassow Robots. It doesn’t have the longest reach (that’s the KR1805) nor is it the most powerful (the KR1018), but it does off an attractive combination of features that make it ideal for many cobot use cases.   With a maximum payload of 5 kg and a reach of 1200 mm, is ideal for lighter-weight processes. Like all Kassow Robots, the KR1205 is based on Kassow’s unique 7-axis design, giving the cobot one degree of freedom more than the average cobot on the market. This allows for more natural and human-like movements that are currently impossible for the great majority of other cobots. Among other things, this 7th axis allows for the robot to make curving movements.  The KR1205 has a repeatability of 0.1 mm, allowing it to make precise and predictable movements. Further, the tablet-based user interface allows even the uninitiated to get started programming their cobot after very minimal training. “Strong, Fast, Simple” is the Kassow Robots motto. Experience it today with the KR1205. Looking for another Kassow? Check out their other cobots here: KR810 – reach 800 mm, payload 10 kg  KR1018 – reach 1000 mm, payload 18 kg KR1410 – reach 1400 mm, payload 10 kg KR1805 – reach 1800 mm, payload 5 kg Pre-built solutions based on Kassow cobots are also available in both mobile (CobotWagen) and stationary (CobotStation) forms.  6 axes good, 7 axes better Most modern robot arms have 6 axes (or degrees of freedom). The Kassow KR1205, on the other hand, has 7. This extra axis allows the cobot to perform much more human-like movements. This 7th axis not only makes the robot more dexterous but allows it to even reach around corners. A robot with curves The innovative design of the KR line of cobots from Kassow Robots allows them to perform an action that is simply impossible for most cobots. Kassow Robots can move in curves. Whereas most robots will only move from A to B in a straight line, the KR1205 can make curves with at a constant speed. This has a wide range of potential applications in welding, adhesive application, and more. A truly collaborative robot True to the name cobot, Kassow Robots are designed to work safely and effectively with people in an industrial environment. After the requisite risk analysis, the cobots can often work with not or limited safety restrictions. This allows them to collaborate and work in conjunction with other employees. Innovative Software Interface Like all Kassow Robots, the KR1205 is easy to program and operate. Thanks to the intuitive software interface, even small and medium-sized companies will be able to program a large number of processes on their own. Beyond the software interface, many other smart features have been built into the KR series, such as the integrated data Ethernet connection.",

			"Text": "SpecificationsTrue to the motto “strong, fast, simple”, Kassow Robots develops and produces uniquely efficient lightweight industrial collaborative robots with 7 axes. With maximum payloads of up to 18 kilograms and maximum reaches of up to 1800 millimeters, Kassow Robots’ cobots are powerful, fast and suitable for use in small spaces due to their maneuverability. They also enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement both simple and complex automation flexibly, independently and cost-effectively.Kassow’s technology is built around their robots’ extraordinarily strong joints. Not only are the joints robust, but they also enable lateral movements thanks to their 7th axis and optimally reproduce the motor function of human arms. This innovation was combined with simple, intuitive programming and operation based on well-known standard tablet technology.These innovative cobots were developed by a team led by Kassow Robots founder and CEO Kristian Kassow, who has already made a significant mark on the industry with his past contributions to the robotics industry.6 axes good, 7 axes better Most modern robot arms have only six axes (or degrees of freedom). The Cobot KR1410 from Kassow Robots, unlike most other manufacturers, offers a 7th axis - and that in combination with unique efficiency. These 7 fully controlled axes allow for significantly more flexibility, because the robot arms can replicate the motor activity of real human arms much better and can even reach around corners. The result: more flexibility in movements. A robot with curves Thanks to their special kinematics, Kassow Robots' cobots can easily follow a given path – moving not only in straight lines, but also in curves - constantly and at a given speed.  This allows the cobot to be used for welding, gluing and more tasks that require a non-linear application at constant speed without settling. A truly collaborative robot The Kassow KR1410 is a lightweight collaborative robot (cobot). It is designed to work with humans in an industrial environment. After a risk analysis, the robot can work with no or limited safety restrictions, which allows it to work with or collaborate with other employees. Innovative Software Interface The Kassow KR1410 cobot is easy to operate and program, even small businesses and medium-sized companies can do this independently.  In addition, intelligent features such as a data Ethernet connection have been built into the cobots.",

			"Text": "SpecificationsTrue to the motto “strong, fast, simple”, Kassow Robots develops and produces uniquely efficient lightweight industrial collaborative robots with 7 axes. With maximum payloads of up to 18 kilograms and maximum reaches of up to 1800 millimeters, Kassow Robots’ cobots are powerful, fast and suitable for use in small spaces due to their maneuverability. They also enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement both simple and complex automation flexibly, independently and cost-effectively.Kassow’s technology is built around their robots’ extraordinarily strong joints. Not only are the joints robust, but they also enable lateral movements thanks to their 7th axis and optimally reproduce the motor function of human arms. This innovation was combined with simple, intuitive programming and operation based on well-known standard tablet technology.These innovative cobots were developed by a team led by Kassow Robots founder and CEO Kristian Kassow, who has already made a significant mark on the industry with his past contributions to the robotics industry.6 axes good, 7 axes better Most modern robot arms have only six axes (or degrees of freedom). The Cobot KR1805 from Kassow Robots, unlike most other manufacturers, offers a 7th axis - and that in combination with unique efficiency. These 7 fully controlled axes allow for significantly more flexibility, because the robot arms can replicate the motor activity of real human arms much better and can even reach around corners. The result: more flexibility in movements. A robot with curves Thanks to their special kinematics, Kassow Robots' cobots can easily follow a given path – moving not only in straight lines, but also in curves - constantly and at a given speed.  This allows the cobot to be used for welding, gluing and more tasks that require a non-linear application at constant speed without settling. A truly collaborative robot The Kassow KR1805 is a lightweight collaborative robot (cobot). It is designed to work with humans in an industrial environment. After a risk analysis, the robot can work with no or limited safety restrictions, which allows it to work with or collaborate with other employees. Innovative Software Interface The Kassow KR1805 cobot is easy to operate and program, even small businesses and medium-sized companies can do this independently.  In addition, intelligent features such as a data Ethernet connection have been built into the cobots.",

AUBO Robotics helps companies gain a competitive advantage in the manufacturing environment while freeing employees from dangerous and repetitive tasks.A truly collaborative experience The i3 Cobot is lightweight and designed to be easily repurposed from one task to another. The operator can teach the robot by guiding it manually (inverse kinematic motion planning). This allows operators without programming skills to teach the cobot new actions and tasks. It can also be taught new processes via a teach pendant interface (forward kinematics). Open-source architecture The i3 Cobot is not only easy to teach and program, but also open and expandable. A CAN bus network is used in this robot, which allows multiple microcontrollers to communicate with each other. In addition, compatibility with ROS (Robot Operating System) is supported through an API. Finally, the hardware uses BUS protocols with open I/O interface extensions. Built with safety in mind The AUBO i3 is designed to work safely in collaboration with its human counterparts. The following safety features are built into the i3: Safety-monitored stop, speed and separation monitoring, manual guidance, and force limitation. A high price-performance ratio Between its ease of integration and the fact that even non-programmers can teach it new processes, the AUBO i3 offers an attractive return on investment. In addition, its lightweight design and small footprint make it easy to deploy from one station and process to another.",
