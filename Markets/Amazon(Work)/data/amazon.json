Each component has gone through dozens of iterations of 3D printing. And we use high-strength injection molded parts to provide the best protection to prevent collisions and dust from entering (Bittle is not waterproof however).In the pressure test, the assembled robot can withstand adult stepping on it.

It makes getting started programming for Bittle robot dog easy and accessible for everyone. The course assumes basicfamiliarity with graphical programming.                    If you are a complete beginner, you can start with Codecraft Introduction to Graphical programming course first.        Active online community            As a joint project between Petoi and TinkerGen, Bittle has a support of active online community, including forums, professionally written documentation and experts from the team ready to help users with issues if they arise.

The onboard 2x5 socket is used to connect the Raspberry Pi or other AI chips                Rich extensions                Bittle's main board NyBoard V1 is a custom Arduino board with 4Pin connectors on the board.  You can configure various Grove modules for Bittle to bring a totally new perception to Bittle.                    4 grove interfaces can be connected with external sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors (it can be held in the mouth, very cute)        Read more        Main components                Here are the main components you can see when you look at Petoi Bittle Robot Dog:        servos in every joint, that needs to be moved, namely shoulder and hip joints and head pan jointbattery installed under the bellymainboard with control chip and some modules under black cover        Servos                Servos are motors, that can be precisely controlled to be turned to a certain angle. A servo is very similar to electric motor - in fact it IS an electric motor with a controller chip, a potentiometer and gears for reducing speed all packed inside of plastic casing.                    Potentiometer can be used to measure the angle of rotation of the shaft - and using control circuit we can move servo shaft to precise degree, unlike with simple DC motor, where we can only control the direction and speed. All that makes servos uniquely useful in robots applications.                Battery                The battery used in Bittle is a lithium-ion battery. A lithium-ion battery is a lightweight, high-power battery used in computers and mobile phones. That makes it useful for devices that should be lightweight. Lithium-ion batteries work by the movement of lithium ions through a membrane (thin sheet that allows some substances to pass through).                Easy to operate                Bittle has been pre-programmed to be usable out of the box, with a 3D interlocking structure for the body and legs, reducing the use of screws.                    The unique bionic system can perform dynamic movement and has excellent coordination.The bionic structure of the legs gives it more freedom in unstructured terrain.This dynamic mobility can only be seen in some of the best laboratories or some luxury robots of big companies, such as Boston Dynamics Spot or Sony Aibo.

You can think of main control chip as the brain and servo driver chip as a spinal cord in mammals, responsible for motor coordination.                    Supports plugging in the Raspberry Pi (not provided in the kit), powering the Raspberry Pi, and communicating with the Raspberry Pi through the serial port and I2C. Support plugging in the Bluetooth module (not provided in the kit), and using the mobile APP remote control.        Grove connectors            Additionally, on top of the board you can see four Grove connectors: two digital, one analog, and one I2C bus connector.        Neopixel RGB LED            Finally, you also can see seven LEDs on top of the board.These are Neopixel RGB LEDs, each one of them can be addressed individually and its color can be changed.
