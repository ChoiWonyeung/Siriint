			"The Mini DFRobotShop Rover Mobile Smartphone Development Kit is a small, tracked platform which provides all of the parts necessary to experiment with Arduino-based programming, mobile robots and smart phones. In order to accommodate as many smart phones as possible, the phone is mounted to the robot by adhering it to a silicon anti-slip mat*. Smartphone not included.",
			"The frame is made out of durable laser-cut Lexan parts and aluminum brackets. The drive system is comprised of the Tamiya Twin-Motor Gear Box   (must be assembled in configuration A) and a Tamiya Track and Wheel Set . The cell phone is mounted to a servo and bracket which allows the phone to be angled horizontally (0 degrees) to vertically (90 degrees).",
			"No sample apps are available at this time, though should you develop one, we encourage you to submit the app for resale via the RobotShop App Store . Possible projects include:",
			"The DFRobotShop Rover Shield is the ideal “all in one” shield for small, Arduino-based mobile robot development. The shield allows you to power your Arduino using a 3.7V LiPo battery (also included with this kit) and even has a 3.7V LiPo charger onboard, allowing you to charge the battery via USB. The onboard L298P H-bridge (dual brushed DC motor controller) is perfect for controlling two small, low voltage gear motors and allows for full control over speed and direction. Additional features include a universal IR receiver, XBee headers and analog pins broken out (for easy connection to sensors).",
			"* We strongly suggest that your phone use a rubber protective case in the event that the phone falls. Additional mounting suggestion would be to permanently glue (using epoxy) an inexpensive smart phone case (made for your phone) to the bracket.",

All information you need about drones, flying, aerial filming and technology is in this book.",
			"About the Author:",
			"Drones have been around for a long time and are more popular than ever before. People buy drones for personal use, governments buy them for military reasons and organizations for commercial use. Drones can be found and used everywhere, from firefighters to filmmakers to young kids playing in the garden. They are cheap and easy to fly, well most of them of course. That's one of the main reasons why people buy drones, they are cheap. Especially for governments, drones are a cheap alternative for real airplanes and helicopters. For filmmakers too drones are a good alternative for expensive aerial filming with helicopters.",
			"Although drones have a lot of advantages, not everyone likes them. People worry about safety and privacy and governments are creating new regulations. Since the beginning of the upcomming popularity of drones, I have been a huge drone enthousiast. I started reading and searching about aerial filming and other things I could do with my drone. After years of experience with drones I decided to write an ebook for people who are looking for their first drone. There are so many websites with information and you don't know where to start. That's exactly why I wrote my first ebook \"My First Drone\", to give people who are looking to buy their first drone a head start by giving them all information they need to buy the right drone and to start flying as soon and safe as possible.",

			"Nexus Robot introduces the 127mm Omnidirectional Wheel (Brass Bearing for Rollers). The Omni-directional wheels are unique as they are able to roll freely in two directions. The Omni-direction wheels allow a robot to convert from a non-holonomic to a holonomic robot. A non-holonomic robot that uses normal wheels has only 2 out of 3 controllable degrees-of-freedom - moving forward/backwards and rotation. Not being able to move side ways makes a robot slower and less efficient in reaching its given goal.",

Unlike other 'x' (where the front of the UAV is facing between two legs) or '+' (where the front is facing one of the legs) quadcopters and Y-shaped tricopters, the VTail concept uses two angled rear propellers, merging both concepts.",
			"Many tricopter designs use a servo to angle the rear propeller to rotate the aircraft clockwise / counter-clockwise, and have an issue with asymmetry (only two propellers can counter-rotate while the third causes a bit of rotation). A 6-rotor tricopter solves the symmetry issue, but is more expensive as it requires three additional motors and ESCs.",
			"The Mechanics\nThe frame uses G10 fiberglass composite which is incredibly rigid and lightweight and offers significant price advantages over carbon fibre. The hardware is entirely metal, using lightweight aluminium standoffs, steel screws and lock nuts.",
			"Electronics\nThis kit requires a controller which is VTail compatible. The controller's function is to stabilize the quadcopter using onboard sensors (usually a multi-axis gyroscope and/or accelerometer). You can incorporate your own controller which uses a standard 30mm x 30mm or 45mm x 45mm mounting hole pattern (and includes compatibility for VTail designs).",

			"The SparkFun Weather Meter Kit represents the three core components of weather measurement: wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall.",
			"None of the sensors in this kit contain active electronics, instead, they use sealed magnetic reed switches and magnets so you'll need to source a voltage to take any measurements. The positive side of this is that the sensors easy to interpret. The rain gauge is a self-emptying bucket-type rain gauge which activates a momentary button closure for each 0.011\" of rain that are collected.",
			"The anemometer (wind speed meter) encodes the wind speed by simply closing a switch which each rotation. A wind speed of 1.492 MPH produces a switch closure once per second. Finally, the wind vane reports wind direction as a voltage which is produced by the combination of resistors inside the sensor.",

			"The Sequent Microsystems 4 Relays 4 Inputs 8-Layer Stackable Card for Raspberry Pi drive 8A / 240VAC loads and read 3 to 240 V, AC or DC, opto-isolated inputs for all your Home or Industrial Automation Projects.",
			"A perfect add-on to your project when you have to control a large number of heavy-duty AC loads and/or you have to read wide-range inputs. Stackable to 8 layers, the card can add up to 32 relays to each Raspberry Pi in a very compact form factor. In addition, you can read up to 32 opto-isolated inputs.",
			"Pluggable connectors make the 4-RELAYS card easy to use when multiple cards are stacked up. All relays have Normal Open and Normal Close contacts and can switch up to 8A / 240VAC. The optically isolated universal inputs can read AC or DC signals from 3 V to 240 V. The input connectors have a low voltage port which can read signals between 3 V and 24 V, and a high voltage port which can read signals between 24 V and 240 V.",
			"COMPATIBILITY",
			"The card is compatible with all Raspberry Pi versions from Zero to 4. All stacked cards share the I2C bus using only two of the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins to manage all eight cards. This feature leaves the remaining 24 GPIOs available for the user.",
			"POWER REQUIREMENTS",
			"The card needs 5 V to operate and can be powered from Raspberry Pi or from it's own 2 pin pluggable connector. The relay coils are also powered from the 5 V. The card draws 10 mA with all relays off. Each relay needs about 80 mA to turn on. If power is applied to the 2 pin pluggable connector, no other power supply is needed for the Raspberry Pi.",
			"STACKING MULTIPLE CARDS",
			"Up to eight cards can be stacked on your Raspberry Pi. Each card is identified by jumpers you install to indicate the level in the stack. Cards can be installed in any order. A three position jumper selects the stack level. For your convenience, two jumpers are provided with each card.",
			"REVERSE POWER SUPPLY PROTECTION",
			"The board is protected to accidental reverse power supply with a 5.8 A, 39 mOhm MOSFET which breaks the ground line if reverse power is applied.",
			"RESET PUSHBUTTON",
			"Shutting down the Raspberry Pi by turning off the power can result in SD Card failure. To prevent this, a shutdown command needs to be used before power cut-off. But this requires a monitor, keyboard and mouse connected to the Pi. A momentary on push button installed at the edge of the board provides a convenient way to shut down the Raspberry Pi. The button is routed to pin 37 (GPIO 26). You need to write a script which monitors this pin, and if pressed for more than a desired time, issues the shut-down command.",

It allows you to cut them as either left-hand or right-hand threads. The lathe tool can be ground to cut any of the various thread forms, and any of these various pitches or thread forms can be cut on any pitch diameter you desire.",
			"Threads are generated on the Sherline lathe by gearing the spindle to the leadscrew. As the spindle is rotated with the handwheel, the tool will advance an amount determined by the ratio of the gears. When the tool has completed its movement, you simply stop cranking, back up the tool and turn the spindle in the opposite direction until the tool is past its starting point. Then reset the tool and you're ready for the next pass. It is simple, by using a 127-tooth gear (supplied), true metric threads can be cut on an inch (model 4000, 4500, or 4400) or true inch threads on a metric (model 4100, 4530, or 4410) lathe.",
			"Note: Manufacturer has done a special short run of gears with tooth counts in between the ones included in the set. If you need special gears to do a thread count different from the ones mentioned in the table, these gears might help you achieve it.

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

It can even do lots of Robo-One style acrobatic moves. This combo kit includes everything needed to make an operational robot, however, the chassis and servos are available separately for those who want to use their own electronics.\n\nThe Mechanics\nThe robot is made exclusively from brushed, or black anodized aluminum servo brackets from Servo Erector Set. It also includes an electronics carrier made from ultra-tough laser-cut Lexan.\n\nThe Servos\nThe walker is provided with HS-422 servos. Due to the robot's light weight, these servos work well.",

			"VSA provides a graphical timeline of events. Events define a change in position (e.g., a servo) or value (e.g., a stage light dimmer). These colored events can be created consecutively to cause action for one device or created simultaneously for different devices to create a complex series of synchronized movements.",
			"The start and stop values are depicted visually. While events allow motion to be scaled and adjusted as a group, the plot view allows individual start and stop values to be edited. From the plot view, the amplitude of the event values (i.e., servo position or dimmer value) can be adjusted with a quick drag and drop operation. Events can also be matched with the graphically depicted wave/MP3 and AVI files, greatly simplifying DJ lighting and animatronic lip sync.",
			"Timeline events specify servo speed, relay position, and dimmer fade. Every animator has faced the challenge of sending commands in small step increments to produce the illusion of a variable servo or dimmer. Realizing that variable control is a necessity in any show production, VSA events are defined by a start and a stop value. When VSA encounters an event during playback, it automatically interpolates between the start and stop values to create a smooth motion or fading effect.",
			"Import, mirror, and repeat events. In the course of any production, the same series of events will probably need to be repeated. VSA provides several options: first, series of events can be grouped and imported in to other routines. Second, a group of events can be highlighted and repeated any number of times. Third, an excellent technique for creating iterative motions, groups of events to be selected and then mirrored.",
			"Visually define the position of a servo and brightness of a dimmer. VSA takes the guesswork out of determining the right position for a servo or dimmer. Rather than entering an obscure integer, VSA allows you to select the right value using a virtual device. As you drag the servo's arm or increase the brightness using the mouse or joystick, real-time commands are sent to the hardware. The entire show can be scripted without programming any value or code.",
			"VSA events are edited in a drag & drop environment. VSA allows you to create and resize events by simply dragging with the mouse. As you drag, VSA draws guidelines that span the vertical axis, enabling events to be precisely aligned with the audio, video, and other events. Additionally, events can be grouped together and then moved or scaled as one -- allowing complex actions to be quickly modified as a whole.",
			"Playback is animated and supports the use of multiple sound cards. As you begin to refine your routines, you will find the playback capabilities of VSA impressive. As VSA plays the routine, a play bar marks the current position -- showing you exactly which events are being executed and allowing you to halt or pause playback. VSA even helps you fine tune portions by providing markers that enable you to playback small parts of a routine. During playback, VSA can also output different audio files to multiple sound cards and different video streams to different monitors. For example, each animated character in a skit could have its own USB sound card and speakers.",

			"The Biosignalsplux Respiration (RIP) Biometric Sensor has been specifically designed having dynamic conditions in mind (e.g. effort trials, ambulatory sensing, etc.). The sensing element is embedded in the chest strap fabric and spans its full length. Unlike our affordable piezoelectric (PZT) sensor (which only measures the displacement in a localized manner), the RIP option measures the overall displacement of the thorax or abdomen, making it more immune to motion-induced artifacts.",
			"The elastic strap is can be adjusted in length, enabling the sensor to be applied in different anatomies (e.g. male and/or female) and body locations (e.g. thorax and/or abdomen). Typical applications include monitoring of respiratory rate, respiratory cycle regularity, relative amplitude of the cycle, and others. When multiple sensors are used simultaneously it enables diaphragmatic versus thoracic breathing assessment (e.g. for biofeedback).",
