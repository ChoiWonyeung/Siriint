			"The Hummingbird Duo Classroom Kit has everything you need to build a robot. It contains all the electronics you need for a class + curriculum, glossary, USB flash bands, and other helpful tools and materials. Just add craft materials and watch the robots fly. Hummingbird is designed to enable engineering and robotics activities for ages 13 and up (8 with adult supervision) that involve the making of robots, kinetic sculptures, and animatronics built out of a combination of kit parts and crafting materials.",
			"Combined with very easy-to-use visual programming environments like Scratch, Snap, the Visual Programmer, and Ardublock, Hummingbird provides a great way to introduce kids to robotics and engineering with construction materials that they are already familiar with. At the same time, Hummingbird continues to provide new challenges by allowing programming in the Arduino environment, Python, Java, and Processing, and by supporting Raspberry Pi. It is a robotics kit that is equally challenging and compelling to the beginner and expert.",
			"Hummingbird Duo Controller\nThe Hummingbird Duo is essentially two boards in one: it operates as either an original Hummingbird controller or as an Arduino Leonardo with an integrated motor/servo shield and improved connectors. With the Hummingbird Duo, the Arduino has been built right into the controller, so that anyone who wants to can immediately take that next step. The Duo controller will be the core of all Hummingbird kit. All kit components are soldered with 24\" braided wires and terminate in bare, tinned wire to prevent wire fraying. Securely connecting them to the Duo controller is easy due to Duo's clear labels and spring-loaded terminal blocks.",

It can complete the measurement of wide horizontal FOV and output the grey and depth information at the same time. With its specially optimized obstacle avoidance mode, the detecting area of interest could be set, and the single-point projection distance information of the nearest distance point could be transferred through CANBUS. Compared with single-line scanning LiDAR, CE30-A does not contain any rotating compartments, which could ensure the reliability of the long-time work and a wider vertical detecting range.",
			"The ranging principle of CE30-A is based on Time of Flight (TOF). CE30-A emits modulated near-infrared light, which will be reflected by the object and received by CE30-A again. CE30-A calculates the phase difference and time difference between the emitted and received light, which will be further converted to the clearance of the shot scene.",

			"The Lynxmotion Symmetric Quadruped Kit (FlowBotics Studio) is the FlowBotics Studio version of the 3DoF per leg quadruped robot with a symmetric body design. The kit includes the SSC-32 servo controller as well as a serial to XBee breakout board, a bluetooth module and a full copy of FlowBotics Studio. To control the robot, you create walking sequences within the FlowBotics Studio, and commands are send in real time via Bluetooth to the robot. All higher level mathematics is offloaded to the computer. The software is also compatible with a USB PS2, allowing you to more easily control the robot's motion. The robot's symmetry makes this a very unique quadruped walker. The three DOF (degree of freedom) leg design provides the flexibility required to walk in any direction. The robot uses four HS-645MG servos along with four HS-422 servos. The combo kit includes everything you need to make a functional robot except batteries, charger and optional PS2 controller. This research level robot is perfect for college robotics labs and individuals looking to get started with creating code for quadruped robots.",
			"Controlling the Robot\nThe combo kit comes with the SSC-32 servo controller and the Bluetooth module. There is no separate wiring for a PS2 controller since the PS2 system (sold separately) includes all necessary wiring. By offloading the servo pulse generation and sequence movement timing to the SSC-32, the main board has plenty of power to do some really cool things. The basic PS2 code allows you to control the robot using a wireless (or wired) PS2 remote control (sold separately). Manufacturer strongly recommends the wireless PS2 controller to get the robot up and running quickly. With the proper configuration, the popular hexapod Phoenix code has been adapted to the quadruped to help you get started.",

Don't let the small size fool you - these gearboxes pack a lot into a small package. BotsIQ teams, FIRST teams, schools, companies, and individuals provided input into the design.",
			"Features:",
			"Assembly:",
			"Gearboxes are delivered assembled and tested; however, each will need to be disassembled to grease and mount the motor prior to use. No special tools are required, typically only a screw driver and Allen wrench. A small arbor press or bench vise is useful for pushing the pinion onto the motor shaft. The gearbox must be greased prior to use, grease is not included and must be purchased separately. Banebots recommends Mobil XHP 222 Special grease; however, most lithium based ball bearing grease can be used. Grease can be readily purchased from most local auto parts stores or online suppliers.",

			"The ESP8266 Thing Development Board w/ Headers is a development board that has been solely designed around the ESP8266, with an integrated FTDI USB-to-Serial chip. The ESP8266 is a WiFi-enabled microcontroller. Like any microcontroller, it can be programmed to blink LEDs, trigger relays, monitor sensors or automate coffee makers. With an integrated WiFi controller, the ESP8266 is a one-stop shop for almost any internet-connected project.",
			"To top it all off, the ESP8266 is incredibly easy to use; firmware can be developed in Arduino and uploaded over a simple serial interface. The ESP8266 Thing Development Board breaks out all of the module’s pins with pre-soldered headers, and the USB-to-serial converter means you don’t need any peripheral components to program the chip. Just plug in a USB cable, download the Arduino board definitions, and start IoT-ing.",
			"Features",
			"The Thing Dev Board even includes a PCB trace antenna as a default WiFi antenna. If you need to connect a more sensitive antenna, or need to route outside an enclosure, a U.FL connector is also available on the board.",

			"The pins are broken out to two breadboard-compatible rows",
			"The USB connector sits next to an optional power supply input",
			"It also features an ON/OFF switch, controlling power to the ESP8266",
			"LEDs toward the inside of the board indicate power, charge and status of the IC",
			"The ESP8266’s maximum voltage is 3.6V, so the Thing has an onboard 3.3V regulator to deliver a safe, consistent voltage to the IC",
			"I/O pins also run at 3.3V; you’ll need to level shift any 5V signals running into the IC",
			"The board includes footprints for a 2-pin JST, 2-pin 3.5mm screw terminal, or a simple 0.1\"-pitch 2-pin header",
			"Unlike the original ESP8266 Thing, the ESP8266 Thing Dev Board does not have a built-in LiPo charger"

			"The Sherline 5800 Series 18-Inch NexGen Milling Machine CNC Ready (Metric) is a new generation of vertical milling machine from Sherline. With the increase of popularity of Sherline mills in industrial, laboratory and school training environments, the need to produce larger parts has led to the development of an extended capacity milling machine.",
			"Standard Features",
			"Extra-rigid Column Base—To take maximum advantage of the extended column travels on this extra capacity Sherline mill, the column base has been increased in cross-section for additional rigidity. The ability to swing the column arm from side to side has been eliminated in order to maximize the column’s ability to maintain its position during heavy cuts. The column still rotates left and right 90° and the in/out adjustment is still available, giving it seven directions of movement including X, Y, Z, and headstock rotation on the column itself.",
			"15″ Extended Column Bed",
			"The standard 11″ column with 5.38″ of Z-axis travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 15″ column that provides 9.38″ of vertical movement for use on larger parts or taller set-ups.",
			"18″ Extended Mill Table",
			"The standard 13″ mill table with 8.65″ of travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 18″ table that provides 13.65″ of X-axis travel.",
			"18″ Mill Base",
			"The standard 14″ mill base has been replaced with an 18″ base that provides an additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. This is made more usable with the inclusion of a P/N 1297 mill headstock spacer block that adds an additional 1.25″ of throat distance to take advantage of the additional travel.",
			"7″ x 13″ Tooling Plate",
			"The included tooling plate makes holding parts easy. It has three T-slots as well as a pattern of drilled and tapped 10-32 holes for use with clamps and hold-down sets. Once the plate is squared with the mill, steel alignment pins speed up the process of making sure your parts and fixtures are also square with the mill.",
			"Y-axis Leadscrew Protection",
			"Clear plastic accordion way covers protect the front half of the Y-axis leadscrew from chips. The covers are extra long to accommodate the additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. In addition, a longer 12″ brass tube extending through the column base protects the rear half of the leadscrew from chips.",
			"Other Standard Features",
			"Include oilers on the X-, Y- and Z-axes to keep the column leadscrew and base saddle leadscrews and ways lubricated during extended CNC operations. In addition, backlash is adjustable on X-, Y- and Z-axes. Adjustable tapered plastic gibs provide a way to accommodate wear on the aluminum and steel dovetailed slides on all three axes.",

The RGBL1860 features an Analog, and several Digital and Pulse I/Os which can be remapped as command or feedback inputs, limit switches, or many other functions. It accepts commands received from an RC radio, Analog potentiometer, wireless modem, or microcomputer. Using CAN bus, up to 127 controllers can be networked at up to 1Mbit/s on a single twisted pair.",
			"Numerous safety features are incorporated into the controller to ensure reliable and safe operation. The controller's operation can be extensively automated and customized using Basic Language scripts. The controller can be configured, monitored and tuned in realtime using a Roboteq's free PC utility. The controller can also be reprogrammed in the field with the latest features by downloading new operating software from Roboteq.",

The shield form-factor mates directly with any dev board that has an Arduino standard footprint and equips it with wireless communication capabilities using the popular XBee module. This unit works with all XBee modules including the Series 1 and 2, standard and Pro versions. The serial pins (DIN and DOUT) of the XBee are connected through an SPDT switch, which allows you to select a connection to either the UART pins (D0, D1) or any digital pins on the Arduino (D2 and D3 default). Power is taken from the 5V pin of the Arduino and regulated on-board to 3.3VDC before being supplied to the XBee.",
			"The shield also takes care of level shifting on the DIN and DOUT pins of the XBee. In the latest revision the diode level shifter is replaced with a more robust MOSFET level shifter. The board also includes LEDs to indicate power and activity on DIN, DOUT, RSSI, and DIO5 pins of the XBee. The Arduino’s reset button is brought out on the shield, and a 9x11 grid of 0.1\" holes are available for prototyping.",

			"The RoboteQ MGSW1600 All-metal Shock-Resistant 160mm Wide Magnetic Track Sensor is capable of detecting and reporting the position of a magnetic field along its horizontal axis. The sensor is intended for line following robotic applications, using a magnetic tape to form a track guide on the floor. The MGSW1600 is built into a rugged, watertight, all-metal eclosure. It uses a 8-pin waterproof M12-type connectors for its power supply and IO signals.",
			"The sensor uses advanced signal processing to accurately measure its lateral distance from the center of the track, with millimeter resolution, resulting in nearly 160 points end to end. Tape position information can be output in numerical format on the sensor's RS232 or USB ports. The position is also reported as a 0 to 3V voltage output and as a variable PWM output. Additionally, the sensor supports a dedicated MultiPWM mode allowing seamless communication with all Roboteq motor controllers using only one wire. The sensor will detect and manage up to 2-way forks and can be instructed to follow the left or right track using commands issued via the serial/USB ports, or using the state of two digital inputs. All of the sensor's operating parameters and commands are also accessible via its CAN bus interface.",
			"In addition to detecting a track to follow, the sensor will detect and report the presence of magnetic markers that may be positioned on the left or right side of the track. The sensor is equipped with four LEDs for easy monitoring and diagnostics. The MGSW1600 includes a 3-axis Gyroscope that can be used to provide additional stability and guidance to the vehicle.",
