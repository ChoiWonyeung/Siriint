Needless to say, this is a very handy sensor that doesn’t require much setup.",

This acoustic power combined with continuously variable gain, real-time background automatic calibration, real-time waveform signature analysis, and real-time noise rejection algorithms results in virtually noise free distance readings for most users.  This holds true even in the presence of many of the various acoustic or electrical noise sources.  The XL-MaxSonar® sensor line is available with factory calibrated beam patterns and can be used anywhere an indoor acoustic range sensor is needed.",

The integrated 2 way DC motor driver and wireless socket allows you to start your project immediately without the need for an additional motor driver or wireless shield. The Romeo v1.1 behaves like standard Arduino Uno which means you can program it directly from the Arduino IDE. This new version has changed the position ICSP pins to make the Romeo compatible with the USB host shield and the Ethernet shield. That means now the Romeo could work perfectly with most Arduino shields. The Romeo v1.1 features the Atmega8U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter. All the pins of the new Romeo use colored pin headers. Commonly use: Green for digital I/O, Blue for analog I/O, Red for voltage",

However, after uploading a new program, your WIZ820io may be left in a prior state depending on where your prior program stopped. Pin 9 should be used to manually trigger the reset pulse for best compatibility with WIZ820io and W5200 chips. See the initialization code below for an example.",
			"A second revision adds pullup resistors on pins 4, 9 and 10, and a reset chip for the WIZ820io. These resistors keep the SD card and WIZ820io/WIZ850io from responding to other SPI communication. Some WIZ820io can disrupt SPI communication before being reset, even of their chip select pin is pulled high. The new reset chip guarantees proper reset at startup, even if the recommended code below is not used.",

			"The ACS723 Low Current Sensor Breakout features a low current version of the SparkFun Current Sensor Breakout is a high accuracy board that utilizes the ACS723 for low to moderate AC and DC current sensing applications. The ACS723 sensor uses a Hall effect sensor to output a voltage relative to the current flowing through the IP+ and IP- pins on the board. The advantage of using a Hall effect sensor, specifically, is that the circuit being sensed and the circuit reading the sensor are electrically isolated meaning that, although your Arduino is running on 5V, the sensed circuit can be operating at higher DC or AC voltages!",
			"This low current sensor breakout is capable of sensing very small currents down to around 10mA and large currents up to 5A! However, since the output is analog, your usable readings will be limited by noise and the resolution of the ADC reading the output.",
			"Additionally, this breakout has full electrical isolation of measured and sensed circuits and (thanks to an on-board amp) can adjust its sensitivity. Although the analog output is adjustable to 80kHz, the bandwidth on the ACS723 Sensor Breakout width filter has been set to 20kHz to reduce noise when using at high gains. The full 80KHz bandwidth that the sensor is capable of can be recovered by closing the JP1 (Bandwidth Select) jumper on the back of the board.",
			"Note: Although the chip itself is rated for up to 2.4kV (RMS) of isolation, the board has not been designed for such high voltage applications.",

			"This Pololu TB67S249FTG Stepper Motor Driver Carrier (1.7 A continuous) is a breakout board that makes it easy to use Toshiba’s TB67S249FTG microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver, which features adjustable current limiting and seven microstep resolutions (down to 1/32-step). In addition, it dynamically selects an optimal decay mode by monitoring the actual motor current, and it can automatically reduce the driving current below the full amount when the motor is lightly loaded to minimize power and heat.",
			"The TB67S249FTG has a wide operating voltage range of 10 V to 47 V and can deliver approximately 1.7 A per phase continuously without a heat sink or forced air flow (up to 4.5 A peak). It features built-in protection against under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature conditions; the carrier board also adds reverse-voltage protection (up to 40 V).",

			"The estimated maximum obstacle size is 70 mm while running circa 4 hrs of nominal driving. While live video streaming you can connect to the Leo Rover up to a distance of 100 meters. Its camera has a resolution of 5 MPx and uses a Fisheye lens with a 170 deg field of view.",
			"By default Leo Rover is remotely controlled with video streaming and UI ready-to-go. It's not autonomous, but it's autonomy-ready. The software is based on Robot Operating System (ROS) which is known for easiness of autonomy and semi-autonomy features implementation.",
			"The simplest way is to add a lidar or stereovision camera to enhance the Rover self-navigation and then build your features on top of that. The Rover itself has one front camera and 4 wheel encoders on board, so it provides video streaming and basic odometry out-of-the-box.",

			"The Aluminum Enclosure (112x61x31mm) has been built tough enough to withstand a truck. This 2mm-thick, die-cast enclosure is rated IP54 against dust and splashing water. Because it’s aluminum, it’s easy to cut and drill so that you can add LCD screens, buttons and cable connections. If you want to “pretty up” your project, hit this with some fine-grit sand paper and buff it or just spray paint it!",
			"This enclosure is perfect for producing “stomp box” style effects pedals. Try combining this with a stomp switch and some of your own secret sauce circuitry to build a sweet custom pedal. The lid fits nicely to the top of the enclosure and is secured with 10mm long #6-32 screws (included). This aluminum enclosure version features a smoother metal finish as well as a more structurally sound design.",

			"The HBL2360 60V 2x75A Brushless DC Motor Controller is a high-current, dual channel controller for hall-sensor equipped Brushless DC motors. The controller uses the position information from the sensors to sequence power on the motors' 3 windings in order to generate smooth continuous rotation. The controller also uses the Hall sensor information to compute speed and measure travelled distance inside a 32-bit counter. The motors may be operated in open or closed loop speed mode. Using low-cost position sensors, they may also be set to operate as heavy-duty position servos.\n\nThe HBL2360 accepts commands received from an RC radio, Analog Joystick, wireless modem, or microcomputer. For mobile robot applications, the controller's two motor channels can either be operated independently or mixed to set the direction and rotation of a vehicle by coordinating the motion of each motor.",

By default, the second cable penetrator is blank, but the light comes with a second penetrator to allow a second light to be connected to the first (daisy-chaining).",
			"The specially designed injection molded acrylic lens ensures a consistent beam angle in both air and water. The case has a built-in mounting bracket with two M3 threaded holes for mounting to your vehicle. The light operates on 10-48V inputs and can accept PWM signals from 3-48V. It is compatible with many common boards like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and PixHawk. The case warms up to a comfortable 55°C (131°F) when operated in air and stays much cooler in water.",

			"The Cytron Maker UNO Plus Microcontroller is specially designed for students learning electronics and programming for the first time. Students can skip the hassle of constructing the basic electronic circuit which is boring and time-consuming. Although it is equally important for them to learn about basic electronics, it can always come later after they have experienced how easy it is to create an awesome project. Start with fun and excitement. Start coding right away and see your board lights up and plays a melody with the press of a button.",
			"The Maker UNO Plus is fully compatible with Arduino. You can share the same library and code. Compared with the original Arduino Uno, Maker UNO Plus has added 12 LEDs, a piezo buzzer and a programmable pushbutton switch. The current of 3.3V is boosted to 500mA from 150mA to support more 3.3V's devices. The DC jack power input socket is removed and the conventional USB Type B is also replaced with the more commonly used USB Micro B.",

			"The Pololu 20A, 5.5 - 50V Single Motor Controller is a discrete MOSFET H-bridge designed to drive large DC brushed motors. The H-bridge is made up of one N-channel MOSFET per leg, and most of the board's performance is determined by these MOSFETs (the rest of the board contains the circuitry to take user inputs and control the MOSFETs). The board has an absolute maximum voltage rating of 50 V. The higher voltages can permanently destroy the motor driver. Under normal operating conditions, ripple voltage on the supply line can raise the maximum voltage to more than the average or intended voltage, so a safe maximum voltage is approximately 44 V.",

The major difference in this version of the Bus Pirate comes from the shrouded 0.1\" pitch 2x5 pin header, which has been flipped around to help standardize this board. Additionally every pin on this header has been labeled, eliminating the need for a separate I/O pin description document like with earlier versions.",

			"The Phidgets USB Temperature Sensor (AKA PhidgetTemperatureSensor), can be used with E, K, J, and T-type thermocouples. When connected to a K-Type thermocouple, the PhidgetTemperatureSensor can measure temperatures from -200 to +1200 degrees Celsius. The temperature range varies with the type of thermocouple being used. The Phidgets USB Temperature Sensor outputs the temperature in Degrees Celsius or as the Potential Voltage generated by the thermocouple probe.",
			"Cold Junction Compensation- The temperature at the point where the thermocouple wires return to the PhidgetTemperatureSensor (the cold junction) must be taken into account. Measurement of this temperature allows for the compensation of temperature variations of the Phidget that would affect the thermocouple voltages. In the case of the PhidgetTemperatureSensor, an on-board temperature sensor continually monitors the board temperature near the connector and provides the data required by the Phidget APIs to adjust for this.",

It has integrated decoupling capacitors, so external capacitors are not generally necessary. The screw potentiometer on the regulator is worm-gear driven, so small vibrations and movement will not cause the voltage to shift. Use of glue to hold the screw in place is strongly discouraged and could damage the device.",

			"The XL-MaxSonar-WR sensor provides very short to long-range detection and ranging, in a compact, robust PVC housing, designed to meet IP67 water intrusion, and matches standard electrical 3/4\" PCV pipe fittings. The sensor puts 1/2 watt of peak power into the efficient transformer driving the transducer, yielding high output acoustic power. This acoustic power combined with continuously variable gain, real-time waveform signature analysis, and real-time noise rejection algorithms result in virtually noise free distance readings for most users. This holds true even in the presence of many of the various acoustic or electrical noise sources. The XL-MaxSonar-WR1T detects objects from 0-cm to 765-cm (25.1-feet) and provides sonar range information from 25-cm out to 765-cm with 1-cm resolution. Objects from 0-cm to 25-cm range as 25-cm.

The Rover uses two Tamiya Twin-Motor Gear Box , each with their own pair of encoders, as well as a dual motor controller shield** to control the four Mecanum wheels independently. The DFRobotShop Rover PCB incorporates a standard Arduino Uno (surface mount ATMega328), L293B motor driver (connected to pins 5 to 8), voltage regulator and prototyping area and also doubles as part of the mechanical structural of the robot. The onboard voltage regulator allows the entire board to be powered using as little as 3.7V to ~9V*.",
			"The DFRobotShop Rover 2.0 Arduino Compatible Robot builds upon the success of the first generation DFRobotShop Rover V2 - Arduino Compatible Tracked Robot (Basic Kit) and integrates a LiPo charger (charges via USB), solder prototyping area, XBee footprint and more. Mecanum omni directional wheels allows the Rover to move in the following directions:",
			"It is important to note that due to the forces involved, some directions are noticeably slower than others. As an example, forward and backward is considerably faster than direct left and right. Rotating CW / CCW about the center point takes longer than in a 2WD rover.\n\n* Motors included with Tamiya gearbox operate at up to 5V. 6V motors are available separately.\n** The DFRobotShop Rover PCB incorporates a dual motor controller, and the shield adds a dual controller which uses different pins, allowing you to control four DC motors independently.",

			"The CellShield Lithium Battery Low-Voltage Cutoff is a low voltage cutoff device which provides cell-by-cell protection for lithium battery packs. By monitoring each cell individually, CellShield prevents cell overdischarge due to pack imbalance or cell variations.\n\nThe CellShield provides a soft cutoff when the lowest voltage cell of the pack reaches the set minimum voltage. The minimum voltage is adjustable from 2.5v/cell to 3.5v/cell. This lets you set the proper cutoff voltage for your specific pack. For example, 8-10C cells typically use a 3.0v/cell cutoff, while 20C cells work better with a 3.2v/cell cutoff. CellShield's cutoff voltage is set with an easy-to-use potentiometer. There are no programmers to buy or complicated programming procedures. With CellShield, you turn the arrow to the cutoff voltage you want and go fly.\n\nThe CellShield also features optional thermal probes (RB-Dim-15), which prevent pack damage due to overheating. When using the thermal probe, if the battery temperature rises above 150 degrees, CellShield will reduce the throttle command sent to the ESC in an attempt to bring the battery temperature back down. If the battery stays above 150 degrees Farenheint, CellShield will enter soft cutoff mode. When using the thermal probe, CellShield alerts the user to temperature faults by flashing the red Temp light. The thermal probes are extremely thin, and can often be inserted between the innermost cells of the pack, where pack temperature is highest.\n\nThe CellShield installs easily between your receiver and ESC. Simply plug the battery port on the CellShield into the tap connection on your battery, and it will automatically detect the number and cell order for any pack with .1\" tap spacing. If you are running a battery with 2 mm tap spacing like Thunderpower, a 2 mm to .1\" adapter is all that is required to use CellShield. CellShield will then light an LED corresponding to the detected cell. You can even plug the battery tap in \"backwards\" and in any position, and CellShield will operate correctly. No soldering is required to install CellShield.\n\nThe CellShield works with any ESC and power system except some opto-isolated ESCs when used with receiver batteries. For cell-shield to operate, the battery ground and radio ground must be at the same level. This is the case for all ESCs with a built in BEC (whether or not the ESC's BEC is being used) and all ESCs using external BECs.",

			"High Compatibility\nThe Quadrature Encoder Phidget can read incremental encoders with line driver, open collector, or push-pull output circuits by selecting the appropriate mode in API. For line driver and open collector, you can also choose between 2.2 kΩ or 10 kΩ resistors. Basically, if you have a 0-5V quadrature encoder, this adapter can read it. It can read at speeds of up to 100,000 quadrature cycles per second, which is faster than any motor.",

			"The Actuonix L12 Actuator 30mm 210:1 6V PLC/RC Control combines the best features of manufacturer's existing micro actuator families into a highly flexible, configurable and compact platform. It is an axial design which utilizes a powerful PMDC motor and a rectangular cross section for increased strength. It is designed for use within cost-sensitive high-volume OEM products, such as consumer appliances, robots and toys.",
			"Actuonix's unique line of Miniature Linear Actuators enables a new generation of motion-enabled product designs, with capabilities that have never before been combined in a device of this size. This small linear actuator is a superior alternative to designing with awkward gears, motors, servos and linkages. The first member of the L series, the L12, is an axial design with a powerful drivetrain and a rectangular cross section for increased rigidity. But by far the most attractive feature of this actuator is the broad spectrum of available configurations.",

			"This powerful Pololu 2.5-9.5V Adjustable Boost Regulator can generate an output voltage as high as 9.5V from an input voltage as low as 1.5V. A trimmer potentiometer lets you set the boost regulator's output voltage to a value between 2.5V and 9.5V.",
			"It is a very flexible switching regulator (also called a switched-mode power supply, SMPS, or DC-to-DC converter) that can generate voltages higher than its input voltage. Manufacturer also offers another adjustable range of approximately 4V to 25V. The output voltage can be set using the trimmer potentiometer in the upper-right corner of the board. The input voltage range is 1.5V to 16V (the input voltage should be kept below the output voltage). The integrated 2A switch allows for output currents high enough to drive small motors, as in Pololu's 3pi robot, and allows large voltage gains, such as obtaining 24V from two NiMH or NiCd cells. This regulator features a typical efficiency of 80-90% when doubling voltage and with 100-500 mA output.",
			"Application examples:",

			"Easy to use features like a DIP switch for user settings (from current setting to resonance compensation), indicator LEDs for fast diagnosis of proper function, and a universal COMMON input makes for a simple to set up and powerful package. The step pulse multiplier board, the G901X, has four resolution options: Full step (200 PPR), half step (400 PPR), five microstep (1000 PPR), and ten microstep (2000 PPR).",

			"Many tricopter designs use a servo to angle the rear propeller to rotate the aircraft clockwise / counter-clockwise, and have an issue with asymmetry (only two propellers can counter-rotate while the third causes a bit of rotation). A 6-rotor tricopter solves the symmetry issue, but is more expensive as it requires three additional motors and ESCs.",

The combination of chucks, part and drill can eat up a lot of the available center-to-center distance, and a little extra capacity is often appreciated. This lathe offers the same diameter turning capacities as the shorter lathe and same powerful motor/speed control. The differences are both the extra 9″ of center distance and the addition of extras like the adjustable zero handwheels and rocker toolpost, making this lathe a good value for the extra cost.",

			"This Solid-State ToF Infrared LiDAR CE30-D is equipped with its special hardware design. It can complete the measurement of wide horizontal FOV and output the grey and depth information at the same time. Compared with single-line scanning LiDAR that only detect in a horizontal plane, CE30-D can detect lower obstacles. Also, it does not contain any rotating compartments, which could ensure the reliability of the long-time work and a wider vertical detecting range.",
			"The ranging principle of CE30 is based on Time of Flight (TOF). The modulated near-infrared light is emitted from CE30, which will be reflected by an object and received by CE30 again. CE30 calculates the phase difference and time difference between the emitted and received light to determine the distance between the CE30 and a detected object.",
			"Its horizontal field of view is 60 degrees and vertical field of view is 4 degrees. Compared with single-line LiDAR, CE30 has a wider vertical FoV and therefore the object can be better recognized.  In a measuring period, each frame will detect a different distance range. The LiDAR combines all these frames to get all distance data within measuring range.",
			"CE30-D has 20 lines in vertical direction, and the vertical angle resolution is 0.2 degree, so that CE30-D has more precise resolution capacity. The communication protocol stipulates that the length of all commands is fixed to 50 bytes. If the actual length of the command string is shorter than 50 bytes, the last should be filled with 0x00 after the end of command string to reach the length of 50 bytes. After the LiDAR is powered up, a command is needed to start measurement.",
