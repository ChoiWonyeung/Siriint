			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",
			"The first gearbox stage is a worm-and-wheel meaning that the transmission cannot be back-driven once in position. The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",

			"The Pololu Jrk 12A 6-16V USB Motor Controller with Feedback is a highly configurable brushed DC motor controller that supports four interface modes: USB, logic-level serial, analog voltage and hobby radio control (RC). The controller can be used as an open-loop speed control or for closed-loop speed or position control. The continuous output current is approximately 12A (30A max) and the operating range of 6-16V with transient protection up to 40V. The analog voltage and tachometer (frequency) feedback options allow quick implementation of closed-loop servo systems, and a free configuration utility (for Windows 7, Vista, or Windows XP) allows easy calibration and configuration through the USB port.",
			"Key improvements over competing products and earlier Pololu motor controllers with feedback include:",
			"For more main features please see JRK motor controller's user's guide in useful link tab. The Pololu Jrk 12A 6-16V USB Motor Controller comes with a 14×1 straight 0.100\" male header strip and two 5mm, 2-pin terminal blocks. To provide maximum flexibility, none of these parts are soldered to the board. For the most compact installation, you can solder wires directly to the jrk pads themselves and skip using the included hardware. The included hardware allows you to make less permanent connections. You can break the 14×1 header strip into an 8×1 piece and two 3×1 pieces and solder these strips into the jrk's I/O pads.",

While voltage is applied to the motor V+ and ground leads, the actuator extends. If the polarity of this voltage is reversed, the actuator retracts. Actuator stroke position may be monitored by providing any stable low and high reference voltages on leads 1 and 5, and then reading the position signal on lead 2. The voltage on lead 2 will vary linearly between the two reference voltages in proportion to the position of the actuator stroke.",

			"The Actuonix S20 30mm Miniature Linear Stepper Actuator is a rod-style actuator that is built off of the popular L12 platform. Rather than using a DC motor and gearbox, this actuator consists of a NEMA 8 stepper motor mounted directly to the actuator shaft. The S20 offers high-precision positioning in a very compact package that is ideal for mounting in tight spaces.",
			"The S20 actuators are complete, self-contained linear motion devices. Several stroke length options allow these to fit a wide variety of applications. The brushless stepper design makes the S20 our highest precision and longest life actuator.",
			"Actuonix Motion Devices unique line of Miniature Linear Actuators enables a new generation of motion-enabled product designs, with capabilities that have never before been combined in a device of this size. These linear stepper actuators are a superior alternative to designing your own push/pull mechanisms.",
			"The S20 is designed to push or pull a load axially along its full stroke length. The speed of travel is determined by the step frequency, and maximum force by the current applied.",
			"When power is removed the actuator will hold its position, unless the applied load exceeds the back drive force. Actuators should be tested in each specific application to determine their effective life under those loading conditions and environment.",

MeshCAM saves a proprietary gcode for the Nomad so no additional license code is required to use it with the Nomad 3, but it will not generate gcode for other machines.",
			"This desktop mill also comes with Carbide Create 2D CAD/CAM software and Carbide Motion machine control software.",
			"Lastly, all Nomad 3 will include a chip fan to put on their spindle and an interlock key. A Chip fan is super easy to use and helps push away the chips while machining. The interlock key is a safety feature that automatically stops the spindle when the door is open. Carbide Motion will also display a message that says “Door Open”. The interlock key mimics the door being closed so when a customer is setting zero on the stock material, the door can remain open without getting the message in Carbide Motion.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

			"VSA provides a graphical timeline of events. Events define a change in position (e.g., a servo) or value (e.g., a stage light dimmer). These colored events can be created consecutively to cause action for one device or created simultaneously for different devices to create a complex series of synchronized movements.",
			"The start and stop values are depicted visually. While events allow motion to be scaled and adjusted as a group, the plot view allows individual start and stop values to be edited. From the plot view, the amplitude of the event values (i.e., servo position or dimmer value) can be adjusted with a quick drag and drop operation. Events can also be matched with the graphically depicted wave/MP3 and AVI files, greatly simplifying DJ lighting and animatronic lip sync.",
			"Timeline events specify servo speed, relay position, and dimmer fade. Every animator has faced the challenge of sending commands in small step increments to produce the illusion of a variable servo or dimmer. Realizing that variable control is a necessity in any show production, VSA events are defined by a start and a stop value. When VSA encounters an event during playback, it automatically interpolates between the start and stop values to create a smooth motion or fading effect.",
			"Import, mirror, and repeat events. In the course of any production, the same series of events will probably need to be repeated. VSA provides several options: first, series of events can be grouped and imported in to other routines. Second, a group of events can be highlighted and repeated any number of times. Third, an excellent technique for creating iterative motions, groups of events to be selected and then mirrored.",
			"Visually define the position of a servo and brightness of a dimmer. VSA takes the guesswork out of determining the right position for a servo or dimmer. Rather than entering an obscure integer, VSA allows you to select the right value using a virtual device. As you drag the servo's arm or increase the brightness using the mouse or joystick, real-time commands are sent to the hardware. The entire show can be scripted without programming any value or code.",
			"VSA events are edited in a drag & drop environment. VSA allows you to create and resize events by simply dragging with the mouse. As you drag, VSA draws guidelines that span the vertical axis, enabling events to be precisely aligned with the audio, video, and other events. Additionally, events can be grouped together and then moved or scaled as one -- allowing complex actions to be quickly modified as a whole.",
			"Playback is animated and supports the use of multiple sound cards. As you begin to refine your routines, you will find the playback capabilities of VSA impressive. As VSA plays the routine, a play bar marks the current position -- showing you exactly which events are being executed and allowing you to halt or pause playback. VSA even helps you fine tune portions by providing markers that enable you to playback small parts of a routine. During playback, VSA can also output different audio files to multiple sound cards and different video streams to different monitors. For example, each animated character in a skit could have its own USB sound card and speakers.",

There are no metal parts or gears, the Hand is composed exclusively of pieces made of 3D printing and fixing screws. It will be able to perform movements you've never seen in any other Robot.",
			"It is capable of carrying out every grip and position because on each part of the finger a servomotor is mounted which takes care of producing the rotation of the respective joint. The plastic material obtained with 3D Printing has allowed to design shapes of a supreme value, a compact and flexible content of technology. You can print it with the colors that best represent you so you can transform it into an artistic expression.",

Using the NXT Intelligent Brick (sold separately), the Accelerometer (compatible with Lego Mindstorms NXT) Sensor lets your LEGO® MINDSTORMS® creation know which way is up and when your robot tilts left or right, up or down, or side to side. This three axis accelerometer sensor also measures acceleration in three axes x, y and z. Hence, you can measure g forces just like jet fighter pilots and astronauts. It also measures tilt along each axis that tells you if your robot is level so you can build self-leveling robots and much more.",

We don’t know what it is exactly about the SumoBot that gets our customers so excited, but maybe it’s the closest thing to BattleBots or a science fiction future in which robots peacefully manage disagreements for their people.",

			"The Summit XL 4WD Autonomous Robot is a medium-sized high mobility all terrain robot with extreme performance. It is ideal for research and as a testbed for application development both for indoor and outdoor applications. The Summit XL has skid-steering kinematics based on 4 high power motorwheels. Each wheel integrates a hub brushless motor with gearbox and encoder (optional). The odometry is computed with the use of the four encoders (optional) and a high precision angular sensor mounted inside the chassis. The strong mechanical structure allows to carry much heavier loads. There are several suspension shocks possibilities. They can also be mounted at severalpositions to modify the robot clearance. The robot base can navigate autonomously or teleoperated by means of an optional PTZ camera / that transmits video in real time. The common sensor options include a Hokuyo laser scanner and a range of RTK-DGPS kits. It also has internal (USB; RS232, GPIO and RJ45) and external connectivity (USB, 12 and 24VDC) to easily add custom components.",
			"The control architecture is open-source and modular, based on ROS. ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS framework defines a well organized robot software architecture and includes hundreds of user contributed packages and sets of packages called tacks, that implement functionalities as localization and mapping, planning, manipulation, perception, etc. This characteristic simplifies the software development cycle and allows easy integration and reutilization of software components whether they are device drivers or state of the art algorithms in vision, SLAM, point cloud processing, grasping, planning, swarming, etc.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",
			"The first gearbox stage is a worm-and-wheel meaning that the transmission cannot be back-driven once in position. The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

			"The Lynxmotion (LSS) - 3 DoF Robotic Arm (Kit) was designed to be an inexpensive yet highly versatile robotic arm using the fully configurable Lynxmotion Smart Servo (LSS) actuators. The four-bar mechanical design ensures the end effector remains parallel to the surface, and offloads much of the weight of the joints onto the base. Combined with the Lynxmotion conveyor system, a tabletop assembly system can be created within a few hours.",
			"Although well suited for use on a desk for development and experimentation, the arm is meant to be easily fitted to a mobile robot and powered using a 3S LiPo battery (sold separately) with XT60 connector.",
			"The included Mini Parallel Gripper uses a micro servo, acrylic and foam to be as lightweight as possible. The gripper opens to 40mm and the bracket allows it to be mounted horizontally or vertically.",
			"The arm includes three main electronic components: The LSS Adapter makes connecting to a computer, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, XBee or other serial device easy, while the LSS-2IO programmable microcontroller (which control the gripper RC servo)  and LSS-5VR voltage regulator mean the normal RC servo in the gripper can be used with the LSS communication protocol.",
			"CAD design files, as well as examples of how to communicate with the smart servos via Arduino and Python are available so that students and hobbyists can more easily integrate the arm into their projects. The graphical user interface LSS FlowArm, created using FlowBotics Studio, makes recording and playing back sequences effortless.",
