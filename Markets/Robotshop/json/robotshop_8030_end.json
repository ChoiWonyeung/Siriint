The combination of chucks, part and drill can eat up a lot of the available center-to-center distance, and a little extra capacity is often appreciated. This lathe offers the same diameter turning capacities as the shorter lathe and same powerful motor/speed control.

A laser engraved angle scale makes setting the tilt angle easy. As on the rotary column, a clamping ring design locks the column securely at the desired angle. On the back side of this special rotary column attachment is a knuckle that allows the top of the Z-axis column to be tilted either toward or away from the operator.",

In/out travel is 5.50\" and side-to-side motion is indicated by laser engraved scales showing up to 90° of movement either way. It is a fully functional shop mill that fits on a tabletop and stores on a closet shelf. All Sherline mills feature precision machined dovetailed slides with adjustable gibs, permanently lubricated spindle bearings, adjustable preload anti-backlash feed screws and a high-torque 90 VDC motor with electronic speed control. Speed is continuously variable from 70 to 2800 RPM without gear or belt changes. For more information about this product please see the datasheet in useful links tab.",

			"The Sherline 5800 Series 18-Inch NexGen Milling Machine (Metric) is a new generation of vertical milling machine from Sherline. With the increase of popularity of Sherline mills in industrial, laboratory and school training environments, the need to produce larger parts has led to the development of an extended capacity milling machine.",
			"Standard Features",
			"Extra-rigid Column Base—To take maximum advantage of the extended column travels on this extra capacity Sherline mill, the column base has been increased in cross-section for additional rigidity. The ability to swing the column arm from side to side has been eliminated in order to maximize the column’s ability to maintain its position during heavy cuts. The column still rotates left and right 90° and the in/out adjustment is still available, giving it seven directions of movement including X, Y, Z, and headstock rotation on the column itself.",
			"15″ Extended Column Bed",
			"The standard 11″ column with 5.38″ of Z-axis travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 15″ column that provides 9.38″ of vertical movement for use on larger parts or taller set-ups.",
			"18″ Extended Mill Table",
			"The standard 13″ mill table with 8.65″ of travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 18″ table that provides 13.65″ of X-axis travel.",
			"18″ Mill Base",
			"The standard 14″ mill base has been replaced with an 18″ base that provides an additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. This is made more usable with the inclusion of a P/N 1297 mill headstock spacer block that adds an additional 1.25″ of throat distance to take advantage of the additional travel.",
			"7″ x 13″ Tooling Plate",
			"The included tooling plate makes holding parts easy. It has three T-slots as well as a pattern of drilled and tapped 10-32 holes for use with clamps and hold-down sets. Once the plate is squared with the mill, steel alignment pins speed up the process of making sure your parts and fixtures are also square with the mill.",
			"Y-axis Leadscrew Protection",
			"Clear plastic accordion way covers protect the front half of the Y-axis leadscrew from chips. The covers are extra long to accommodate the additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. In addition, a longer 12″ brass tube extending through the column base protects the rear half of the leadscrew from chips.",
			"Other Standard Features",
			"Include oilers on the X-, Y- and Z-axes to keep the column leadscrew and base saddle leadscrews and ways lubricated during extended CNC operations. In addition, backlash is adjustable on X-, Y- and Z-axes. Adjustable tapered plastic gibs provide a way to accommodate wear on the aluminum and steel dovetailed slides on all three axes.",

			"The Sherline 5800 Series 18-Inch NexGen Milling Machine (Inch) is a new generation of vertical milling machine from Sherline. With the increase of popularity of Sherline mills in industrial, laboratory and school training environments, the need to produce larger parts has led to the development of an extended capacity milling machine.",
			"Standard Features",
			"Extra-rigid Column Base—To take maximum advantage of the extended column travels on this extra capacity Sherline mill, the column base has been increased in cross-section for additional rigidity. The ability to swing the column arm from side to side has been eliminated in order to maximize the column’s ability to maintain its position during heavy cuts. The column still rotates left and right 90° and the in/out adjustment is still available, giving it seven directions of movement including X, Y, Z, and headstock rotation on the column itself.",

			"Y-axis Leadscrew Protection",
			"Clear plastic accordion way covers protect the front half of the Y-axis leadscrew from chips. The covers are extra long to accommodate the additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. In addition, a longer 12″ brass tube extending through the column base protects the rear half of the leadscrew from chips.",

			"Almost every digital multimeter will only let you use one mode at a time, meaning that to watch relationships in an active system you need to use multiple meters.  Most have a front panel dominated by a numeric LCD display and a gigantic mode selection knob.  Having the display mounted on the measurement hardware makes it very difficult to measure moving or enclosed systems, because the user must have clear line of sight to the meter to be able to read it.

Reach runs open-source RTK engine “RTKLIB” written by Tomoji Takasu.",
			"Affordable\nOne of the challenges with high precision GPS is pricing. If you own one Reach, you can send corrections to unlimited number of other devices in 10km area. RTKLIB is capable of RTCM streaming and thus Reach is compatible with other RTK systems.",

A unique \"Group Move\" allows any combination of servos to begin and end motion at the same time, even if the servos have to move different distances. This is a very powerful feature for creating complex walking gaits for multi servo walking robots. The servo's position or movement can be Queried to provide feedback to the host computer.",

Any output can be used as a TTL level output. There are 4 digital inputs that are static or latched, so you don't have to worry about missing a short event. They can also be used as analog inputs. There are three terminal blocks for powering options. The DB9 input has true RS-232 levels for use with a PC.",

The current is calculated by dividing the voltage drop across the shunt, by its resistance; with the voltage and current known, the power can be calculated.",
			"The maximum voltage drop the INA219 can measure is ±320mV, so the maximum amperage is 3.2A. However, more experienced users could replace this shunt resistor, and change the INA219's gain settings to achieve higher currents and accuracy.",
			"The INA219 supports the I2C interface making it easier to connect multiple devices, and with the use of the Qwiic Connector it couldn't be faster. Useful, as we can retrieve the measurements for voltage, current and power all at the same time!",
			"Measuring any load simply involves connecting the positive terminal of your power source to the VIN+ pin of the green terminal block, and connecting the positive supply of the load to the VIN- pin. Connect the ground lead of the load to the ground of the power supply. There, we have a closed circuit with current flowing to take the measurements.",
			"We've also provided a 2.54mm (0.1in) pin-out so you can attach the sensor to a breadboard if you need to, and make useful test-points if required.",
