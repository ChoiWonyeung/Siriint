The VS1053 is capable of decoding Ogg Vorbis/MP3/AAC/WMA/MIDI audio and encoding IMA ADPCM and user-loadable Ogg Vorbis. The VS1053 receives its input bitstream through a serial input bus (SPI). After the stream has been decoded by the IC, the audio is sent out to both a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack, as well as a 2-pin 0.1\" pitch header.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , 6V, 12V and 24V motor options are available.",
			"The first gearbox stage is a worm-and-wheel meaning that the transmission cannot be back-driven once in position. The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",
