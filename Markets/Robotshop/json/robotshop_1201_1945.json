			"The Lynxmotion Hunter VTail 400 QuadCopter Kit (Base Combo Kit) is a high performance quadcopter. Unlike other 'x' (where the front of the UAV is facing between two legs) or '+' (where the front is facing one of the legs) quadcopters and Y-shaped tricopters, the VTail concept uses two angled rear propellers, merging both concepts.",
			"Many tricopter designs use a servo to angle the rear propeller to Yaw (rotate horizontally) the aircraft clockwise / counter-clockwise, and have an issue with asymmetry (only two propellers can counter-rotate while the third causes a bit of rotation). A 6-rotor tricopter solves the symmetry issue, but is more expensive as it requires three additional motors and ESCs.",
			"The Mechanics\nThe frame uses G10 fiberglass composite which is incredibly rigid and lightweight and offers significant price advantages over carbon fiber. The hardware is entirely metal, using lightweight aluminium standoffs, steel screws and lock nuts. The ''400'' refers to the diameter of the circle which passes through all four motors and is commonly used as a size reference for multi-rotor UAVs.",
			"Electronics\nThis kit requires a controller which is VTail compatible. The controller's function is to stabilize the quadcopter using onboard sensors (usually a multi-axis gyroscope and/or accelerometer). You can incorporate your own controller which uses a standard 30mm x 30mm or 45mm x 45mm mounting hole pattern (and includes compatibility for VTail designs).",

			"The Cytron Simple Rotary Encoder Kit comes out with a slotted disc (8 slots) and a simple interface sensor board. No further soldering is required. The rotary encoder is a sensor or transducer used to convert the data of rotary motion into a series of electrical pulses which is readable by controller. The slotted disc has a 35mm outside diameter with 8 slots that provides 16 transitions. The optical sensor is used to sense the 16 transitions of the slotted disc. With these transitions, controller is able to recognize the rotary angle of the disc. With this concept, a rotary encoder can be employed in a DC motor shaft for the controller to 'know' its current position.",
			"The rotary encoder modules can be used for sensing motor's position and velocity. It can be connected to any microcontroller via the 3 pin header. The optical beam sensor detects missing slots of the slotted disc, and generates a pulse train. These modules require +5V and GND to power them, and provide a 0V to 5V output. They provide +5V output when their beam is blocked, and a 0V output when their beam is unblocked. Your microcontroller can simply read the 0-5-0V pulse train to determine how far your motor has traveled and how fast.",

			"The new and improved Maxbotix LV-MaxSonar-EZ0 Sonar Module detects objects from 0 to 254 inches (6.45 meters) and provides sonar range information from 6 to 254 inches with a 1 inch resolution. Objects between 0-inches and 6-inches range as 6-inches. The new LV version offers better low voltage compatibility for those using 3.3V (2.5 to 5.5V) in their systems.\n\nThe LV-MaxSonar-EZ0 offers very short to long-range detection and ranging, in an incredibly small package with ultra low power consumption. The interface output formats included are pulse width output, analog voltage output, and asynchronous serial digital output.\n\n\nThe LV-MaxSonar-EZ0 features:\n• Very low price\n• The lowest power consumption\n• Superior beam shape\n• Stable Range Readings\n• No central blind spot\n• The smallest PCB\n• Mounting holes\n• Detects objects from 0 to 254 inches (6.45 meters)\n• Provides range of objects from 6 to 254 inches (6.45 meters)\n• Serial (0-5V), Analog voltage or PW output\n• 42 KHz ultrasonic ping\n• Free run or trigger operation\n• Worldwide patents pending\n• 1-year warranty\n\nMany applications require different beam widths or different sensibility. Consequently, Maxbotix is also offering the Maxbotix LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 High Performance Sonar Module , Maxbotix LV-MaxSonar-EZ3 High Performance Sonar Module and Maxbotix LV-MaxSonar-EZ4 High Performance Sonar Module with progressively narrower beam angles, allowing this sensor to match the application.",

			"The DFRobotShop Rover Shield is the ideal “all in one” shield for small, Arduino-based mobile robot development. The shield allows you to power your Arduino using a 3.7V LiPo battery (also included with this kit) and even has a 3.7V LiPo charger onboard, allowing you to charge the battery via USB. The onboard L298P H-bridge (dual brushed DC motor controller) is perfect for controlling two small, low voltage gear motors and allows for full control over speed and direction. Additional features include a universal IR receiver, XBee headers and analog pins broken out (for easy connection to sensors). When stacking multiple shields, or when using the shield with an Arduino-based board which has additional built-in features, be sure to check the pins which are used, as some may interfere with one another.",

The major difference with this board is that it brings out the DTR pin as opposed to the RTS pin of the FTDI cable. The DTR pin allows an Arduino target to auto-reset when a new Sketch is downloaded. This is a really nice feature to have and allows a sketch to be downloaded without having to hit the reset button. This board will auto reset any Arduino board that has the reset pin brought out to a 6-pin connector.",

This board has TX and RX LEDs that allow you to actually see serial traffic on the LEDs to verify if the board is working, but this board requires a miniB cable.

			"The Pololu QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array has 8 IR LED/phototransistor pairs mounted on a 0.375\" pitch, making it a great detector for a line-following robot. Pairs of LEDs are arranged in series to halve current consumption, and a MOSFET allows the LEDs to be turned off for additional sensing or power-savings options. Each sensor provides a separate digital I/O-measurable output. The QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor.",
			"The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control.",
			"The LED current-limiting resistors for 5V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3V. The LED current is approximately 20-25 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA.",
			"Breaking the Module in Two:\nIf you don't need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown in image. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor.",

			"The Interlink Electronics 0.2” Circular FSR uses a 0.2\" circular pad to sense applied force. Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) are very thin, robust, polymer thick film (PTF) devices that decrease in resistance when increased pressure is applied to the surface of the sensor. FSRs are not a load cell or strain gauge devices though they have many similar properties. They are more appropriate for qualitative rather than precision measurements.",

			"Need more current? If you've got a larger motor waiting to be used, the Pololu High Current Motor Driver Board 14A 6V-16V is just what you need. Connect three digital lines to your microcontroller (five if you want error condition feedback), and you're ready to go! The Pololu High Current motor driver board is a compact solution for using the VNH2SP30 motor driver integrated circuit. The board incorporates most of the components of the typical application diagram on page 7 of the VNH2SP30 datasheet, including pull-up and current-limiting resistors and a FET for reverse battery protection. All you need to add is a microcontroller or other control circuit to turn the H-Bridge on and off.",
			"In a typical application, the motor power supply is connected at the bottom of the board, the motor on the right side of the board, and the control connections to the left side of the board. The diagnostic pins can be left disconnected if you do not want to monitor the fault conditions of the motor driver chip. INA and INB control the direction of the motor, and the PWM pin turns the motor on or off.",
			"Real-world power dissipation considerations:",
			"The motor driver has a maximum current rating of 30 A continuous. However, the chip by itself will overheat at much lower currents. That is why it is suggested that you use it at 14A continuous. The actual current you can deliver will depend on how well you can keep the motor driver cool. In our tests, we were able to deliver short durations (on the order of milliseconds) of 30 A and a few seconds of 20 A without overheating. At 14 A, the chip gets just barely noticeably warm to the touch. For higher currents, a heat sink will be necessary. The motor and power supply wires should also be soldered directly instead of going through the terminal blocks, which are rated for up to 15 A.\n\nMany motor controllers or speed controllers can have peak current ratings that are substantially higher than the continuous current rating; this is not the case with the VNH2SP30, which has a 30 A continuous rating and a over-current protection that can kick in as low as 30 A (45 A typical). Therefore, the stall current of your motor should not be more than 30 A. (Even if you expect to run at a much lower average current, the motor can still draw high currents when it is starting or if you use low duty cycle PWM to keep the average current down.)\n\nReverse-battery protection\nThe motor driver board includes an N-channel MOSFET for reverse-battery protection. This component keeps the motor driver from destroying itself if the input power is accidentally connected backwards. However, this component does slightly increase the total resistance between your battery and your motor, and it limits the operating voltage to a maximum of 20 V. For slightly improved performance or for higher-voltage applications, the MOSFET can be bypassed by connecting the negative battery terminal to the bypass pin. (This terminal will also need to be connected to your logic supply ground.)",

			"The Lynxmotion SSC-32U Bluetooth Servo Controller is a Bluetooth version of the very popular SSC-32 servo controller board.  It has a USB port, an Xbee socket with Bluetooth Bee (included), and improved power circuit for building single-battery robots.",
			"Lynxmotion SSC-32U Servo Controller\nThe Lynxmotion SSC-32U Servo Controller is a small preassembled servo controller with some big features. It has high resolution (1uS) for accurate positioning, and extremely smooth moves. The range is 0.50mS to 2.50mS for a range of about 180°. The motion control can be immediate response, speed controlled, timed motion, or a combination. A unique \"Group Move\" allows any combination of servos to begin and end motion at the same time, even if the servos have to move different distances. This is a very powerful feature for creating complex walking gaits for multi servo walking robots. The servo's position or movement can be Queried to provide feedback to the host computer.",
			"There is even a 12 servo Hexapod sequencer built in. This allows complete control of all aspects of the alternating tripod gait simply by transferring a few values from the host controller. Any output pin can be used as a TTL level output. There are 8 analog inputs pins for reading sensor values, and 6 of them can be used as static or latched digital inputs, so you don't have to worry about missing a short event.",
			"The new SSC-32U board has improved power and communication management. The board still has three terminal blocks, but the new power circuit means that most of the time you will only need to use VS1. With the new board, the logic circuits have large capacitors to protect against brownouts, and the logic has auto power select so the VL=VS1 jumper isn't needed anymore. For communication, in addition to having USB on-board, the SSC-32U has an Xbee socket for easy use with wireless devices such as XBees and Bluetooth.",
			"Features:",
			"SSC-32 Servo Sequencer Utility (created using FlowBotics Studio)",
			"The Lynxmotion SSC-32 Servo Controller board can be easily controlled with the new SSC-32 Servo Sequencer Utility. It is available as a free downloadable utility which makes it easy to experiment with robotics and animatronics. It can be found in the Useful Links section.",
			"This utility is an example of the type of program which can be built using FlowBotics Studio (Download) , which includes this program as an open source demo project. The SSC-32 Servo Sequencer Utility program enables you to easily move servo motors, calibrate their position, store and playback motion sequences, upgrade the SSC-32 firmware and more.",

It enables a new generation of motion-enabled product designs, with capabilities that have never before been combined in a device of this size. These tiny linear actuators are a superior alternative in designing your own push/pull mechanisms.",
			"The –S actuators have limit switches that will turn off power to the motor when the actuator reaches within 1mm of the end of the stroke. Internal diodes allow the actuator to reverse away from the limit switch. The limit switches cannot be moved. While voltage is applied to the motor power pins (2 & 3) the actuator extends. Reverse the polarity and the actuator retracts. This can be accomplished manually with a DPDT switch or relay, or using an H-Bridge circuit.",

			"The Dimension Engineering 25W Adjustable Switching Regulator is a larger version of our DE-SWADJ adjustable step down voltage regulator. Previously it was necessary to put multiple DE-SWADJ units in parallel to achieve ratings over 1A, which was bulky, expensive and carried with it a considerable increase in dropout voltage. The DE-SWADJ 3 is designed to be stronger, faster and better. It can process 3A of current, typical ripple is 25mV and under ideal circumstances the regulator can be up to 96% efficient.",
			"It continues the ease-of-use of the DE-SWADJ, making it simple to add an adjustable voltage source to a new or existing project with all the efficiency benefits of switch-mode power. The DE-SWADJ 3 is pin-compatible with the common 78XX family of linear voltage regulators, and has a small screw on top that allows you change the output voltage as your project evolves. It has integrated decoupling capacitors, so external capacitors are not generally necessary.\n\nDE-SWADJ3 can deliver a maximum of 25 Watts.\n\nThe screw potentiometer on DE-SWADJ is worm-gear driven, so small vibrations and movement will not cause the voltage to shift. Use of glue to hold the screw in place is strongly discouraged and could damage the device.",

Using our small NiMH battery packs and the Sabertooth 2x10 R/C motor controller means there is plenty of room inside for additional electronics. However, if you run out of room inside we have additional decks that can be added to the top for future expansion. The decks can stack on top of each other, so you can add as many as your project requires. If you have an idea for a deck that you'd like to see, email us! The robot is capable of carrying up to a 5lb payload. We have optional accessories, such as a Pan & Tilt or a Gripper with many more in the works.",

Designed for maximal ease-of-use, it is ready to use in minutes. The controller features a high-performance 32-bit microcomputer and quadrature encoder inputs to perform advanced motion control algorithms in Open Loop or Close Loop (Speed or Position) modes. The MDC22xx features several Analog, Pulse and Digital I/Os which can be remapped as command or feedback inputs, limit switches, or many other functions. The controller's two motor channels can either be operated independently or mixed to set the direction and rotation of a vehicle by coordinating the motion of each motor.",

			"The Gravity Huskylens AI Machine Vision Sensor w/ Silicone Case is an easy-to-use AI machine vision sensor. It is equipped with multiple functions, such as face recognition, object tracking, object recognition, line tracking, color recognition, and tag (QR code) recognition.",
			"Through the UART / I2C port, HuskyLens can connect popular main control boards like Arduino, micro:bit, Raspberry Pi and LattePanda to help you make very creative projects without playing with complex algorithms.",
			"HuskyLens is pretty easy-to-use. You can change various algorithms by pressing the function button. Click the learning button, HuskyLens starts learning new things. After that, HuskyLens is able to recognize them. Additionally, HuskyLens carries a 2.0-inch IPS screen.",
			"So, you don’t need to use a PC in the parameters tuning. Enjoy the convenience it brings, what you see is what you get. HuskyLens is designed to be smart. It has the built-in machine learning technology that enables HuskyLens to recognize faces and objects.",
			"Moreover, by long pressing the learning button, HuskyLens can continually learn new things even from different angles and in various ranges. The more it learns, the more accurate it is. HuskyLens adopts the new generation of specialized AI chip Kendryte K210.",
			"The performance of this special AI chip is 1,000 times faster than that of the STM32H743 when running a neural network algorithm. With these excellent performances, it can capture even fast-moving objects. With the HuskyLens, your projects have new ways to interact with you or the environment, such as interactive gesture control, autonomous robot, smart access control and interactive toy. There are so many new applications for you to explore.",
			"HuskyLens' object-tracking skills can be used to learn specific gestures. It can recognize those learned hand movement patterns and feed their positions. With these data, creating awesome interactive projects are never so easy.",
			"HuskyLens can detect and follow lines. Line follower is not something new, there are plenty of excellent methods and algorithms in this scenario. However, most of them require tedious parameter tuning. This time, HuskyLens provides a new way to do line following simply click the button, then it starts learning and tracking new lines.",
			"Let's enjoy the fun of making with HuskyLens. HuskyLens can be the eyes of robots. which allows your robot to recognize you, understand your hand gesture commands, or help you put stuff in order and so on. With Huskylens, nothing is impossible.",

			"The Conductive Thread - 360 Yards is about 360 yards of conductive thread spun from stainless steel fiber and wound on a spool. You can use it as a creative way to connect various electronics onto clothing projects. This large spool is a great way to get into wearable electronics without a large upfront cost and a large enough quantity to not be afraid of making a few mistakes. What sets this thread apart from the other conductive thread that manufacturer carry is the fact that it's actually spun from stainless steel fibers (as opposed to plated silver) and doesn't have a Nylon core. This means that while it may not be easy to solder to, because it's stainless, it also won't burn up when you touch it with a soldering iron.\n\nAlso, it's somewhat 'hairy' and can be slightly more difficult to work with in close, fine conditions than the other thread. E-Textiles expert suggests waxing the thread for hand sewing, as this should take care of any 'hairy thread' issues. Since waxing is impractical in machine sewing applications, avoid sewing close connections by machine as the 'hairs' could potentially short across small distances.",

An I²C interface accesses nine independent rotation, acceleration, and magnetic measurements that can be used to calculate the sensor’s absolute orientation. The MinIMU-9 v5 board includes a voltage regulator and a level-shifting circuit that allow operation from 2.5 to 5.5 V, and the 0.1″ pin spacing makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1″ perfboards.",
