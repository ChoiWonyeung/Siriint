			"The processor offers 8 modes of operation: slave serial modes, MIDI, and stand-alone modes:",
			"In slave serial modes, the processor receives simple commands from a host microcontroller to execute tasks play(), volume(), advanceTo(), etc, this reduces dramatically the code complexity (audio decoding algorithms) and saves a lot of headaches to the programmer. SmartWAV 2 can play up to 14 channels with high quality stereo sound from a microSD card with universal FAT/FAT32 format. The processor supports 8/16bit, 8Khz-48Khz, mono/stereo, WAVE (.WAV) files with CD Quality.",
			"In stand alone modes: with directly connected external push buttons a full multi-trigger/mixing 10-channel audio system can be achieved without the need of any other host microcontroller/processor.",
			"SmartWAV 2 is not a programmable device, no IDEs, programmers, nor debuggers are needed, it is a ready to plug and play device.",
			"SmartWAV 2 is the most full featured, flexible, powerful and yet easy to use audio processor for embedded systems.",
			"Intelligent polyphonic audio processor",

As the robot drives over the code cards, an OID optical scanner on the bottom of the robot reads the code cards one by one and loads the program. Next, place the robot on a grid made of map cards, and the robot runs the program.",

			"The AT42QT1010 Capacitive Touch Breakout offers a single capacitive touch button with easy-to-use digital I/O pins. If you need to add user input without using a button, then a capacitive touch interface might be the answer. The AT42QT1010 is a dedicated, single-button capacitive sense chip. The chip handles monitoring a conductive area for touch. As long as a touch (e.g. from a finger) is detected, the AT42QT1010 keeps the output line high. Otherwise, the line is kept low. You just need to provide a power source (1.8V - 5V) and ground for the AT42QT1010 to work. Additionally, a PAD pin is available if you would like to create your own external electrode. The AT42QT1010 is designed specifically for human interfaces, like control panels, appliances, toys, lighting controls, or anywhere a mechanical switch or button may be found.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",
			"The first gearbox stage is a worm-and-wheel meaning that the transmission cannot be back-driven once in position. The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

			"LuMini is a miniaturized version of our Lumenati LED line but instead of utilizing 5 by 5 mm APA102 LEDs (APA102-5050), LuMini uses a 2 by 2 mm package (APA102-2020). This allows for incredibly tight pixel densities, and thus, a screen with less pixelation!",

The red anodized base is laser engraved with angle measurements in 1° increments all the way around. A witness mark is engraved on the side of the rotating collar that holds the vise. The locking washers can be loosened, which allows the vise to slide forward and back in the fixture for further adjustment. A locking ring underneath pulls the collar down onto the base to lock it securely when the two hold-down screws are tightened. The low profile tooling plate base only raises the height of the vise 1/2\". Four T-nuts and hold-down bolts are included.",
			"The rotating vise base eliminates clamping and unclamping the vise to produce angles. Once mounted square to the table, the vise can be positioned using the laser engraved protractor scale as a guide for setting the angle. Properly positioned, the rotating base can even be used as a simple rotary table to drill or machine small, radially symmetrically patterns.",

The controller can operate in one of several modes in order to sense the rotor position and sequence power on the motors’ 3 windings in order to generate smooth continuous rotation. The controller also uses the Encoder information to compute speed and measure travelled distance inside a 32-bit counter. The motors may be operated in open or closed loop speed or torque modes. Features several Analog, Pulse and Digital I/Os which can be remapped as command or feedback inputs, limit switches, or many other functions.",
			"The FIM2360 accepts commands received from an RC radio, Analog Joystick, wireless modem, or microcomputer. For mobile robot applications, the controller’s two motor channels can either be operated independently or mixed to move and steer a vehicle. Using CAN bus, up to 127 controllers can be networked at up to 1Mbit/s on a single twisted pair. Numerous safety features are incorporated into the controller to ensure reliable and safe operation. The controller's operation can be extensively automated and customized using Basic Language scripts. The controller can be configured, monitored and tuned in realtime using a Roboteq’s free PC utility.",

The DYNAMIXEL XM-430-W350T & DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250-T servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the ReactorX 200 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The ReactorX 200 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",
			"ROS packages for Kinetic and Melodic on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and 18.04 make it easy to get started with the ReactorX 200 arm. Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The ReactorX 200 Robot Arm has a 55cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 110cm. The working payload for the ReactorX 200 arm is 150g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the ReactorX 200 can lift more than 150g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

			"The Sherline 5800 Series 18-Inch NexGen Milling Machine CNC Ready (Inch) is a new generation of vertical milling machine from Sherline. With the increase of popularity of Sherline mills in industrial, laboratory and school training environments, the need to produce larger parts has led to the development of an extended capacity milling machine.",
			"Standard Features",
			"Extra-rigid Column Base—To take maximum advantage of the extended column travels on this extra capacity Sherline mill, the column base has been increased in cross-section for additional rigidity. The ability to swing the column arm from side to side has been eliminated in order to maximize the column’s ability to maintain its position during heavy cuts. The column still rotates left and right 90° and the in/out adjustment is still available, giving it seven directions of movement including X, Y, Z, and headstock rotation on the column itself.",
			"15″ Extended Column Bed",
			"The standard 11″ column with 5.38″ of Z-axis travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 15″ column that provides 9.38″ of vertical movement for use on larger parts or taller set-ups.",
			"18″ Extended Mill Table",
			"The standard 13″ mill table with 8.65″ of travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 18″ table that provides 13.65″ of X-axis travel.",
			"18″ Mill Base",
			"The standard 14″ mill base has been replaced with an 18″ base that provides an additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. This is made more usable with the inclusion of a P/N 1297 mill headstock spacer block that adds an additional 1.25″ of throat distance to take advantage of the additional travel.",
			"7″ x 13″ Tooling Plate",
			"The included tooling plate makes holding parts easy. It has three T-slots as well as a pattern of drilled and tapped 10-32 holes for use with clamps and hold-down sets. Once the plate is squared with the mill, steel alignment pins speed up the process of making sure your parts and fixtures are also square with the mill.",
			"Y-axis Leadscrew Protection",
			"Clear plastic accordion way covers protect the front half of the Y-axis leadscrew from chips. The covers are extra long to accommodate the additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. In addition, a longer 12″ brass tube extending through the column base protects the rear half of the leadscrew from chips.",
			"Other Standard Features",
			"Include oilers on the X-, Y- and Z-axes to keep the column leadscrew and base saddle leadscrews and ways lubricated during extended CNC operations. In addition, backlash is adjustable on X-, Y- and Z-axes. Adjustable tapered plastic gibs provide a way to accommodate wear on the aluminum and steel dovetailed slides on all three axes.",

			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

Continue your experiments by constructing increasingly complex models: a solar-bot, a moon rover, and a stag beetle. Finally, build a cool praying mantis model that moves like an insect and is powered by a solar cell. The models can also be powered by a battery, allowing operation in all lighting conditions.",

While voltage is applied to the motor V+ and ground leads, the actuator extends. If the polarity of this voltage is reversed, the actuator retracts. The actuator stroke position may be monitored by providing any stable low and high reference voltages on leads 1 and 5, and then reading the position signal on lead 2. The voltage on lead 2 will vary linearly between the two reference voltages in proportion to the position of the actuator stroke.",

			"The PincherX 100 Robot Arm belongs to a new family of arms from Interbotix featuring the DYNAMIXEL X-Series Smart Servo Motors. The X-Series actuators offer higher torque, more efficient heat dissipation and better durability all at a smaller form factor over previous DYNAMIXEL servos. The DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250-T servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the PincherX 100 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The PincherX 100 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",
			"ROS packages for Kinetic and Melodic on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and 18.04 make it easy to get started with the PincherX 100 arm. Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The PincherX 100 Robot Arm has a 30cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 60cm. The working payload for the PincherX 100 arm is 50g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the PincherX 100 can lift more than 50g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

Optionally, you can choose to have cameras on both wrists, maximizing the robot's ability to survey its surroundings. With their position coincident to the robot's gripping digits, the cameras uniquely enable remote users to get an eye on whatever the robot is reaching toward. Each of the robot's arms has five degrees of freedom, excluding the hinging DOF of the gripper joint. The lifting capacity of each gripper is 300 g while the chassis has a carrying capacity of 15 kg.",

A camera mounted on the wrist of right arm provides viewing from virtually any perspective.",
			"With its integrated high bandwidth (11Mbps) WiFi 802.11 wireless module, the system can upload all sensor data (including encoder sensor readings) to a PC or server at rates in excess of 10Hz. Similarly, streaming audio and video (up to 30 fps) either for direct monitoring or for processing by high-level AI schemes is a snap. The commands and instructions sent to the SCOUT2 via the same wireless link also pass at rates exceeding 10Hz, providing real-time control and access.",
			"The Dr. Robot Scout2 WiFi Mobile Development Platform (w/ Dual arms) includes all WiRobot development software components (for MS Windows 2000 and up), enabling easy access to all data and information in a standard Microsoft Windows programming environment (e.g., MS VB and VC++). Under the approach of using a separate PC for high-level control, there are no longer onboard restrictions on a mobile system's processing power, memory and storage.

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

			"The Advanced Robotic Manipulator (ARM 3.0) - Open Loop is a six-axis robotic arm with an open control interface to allow simple implementation into other projects. Each joint is commanded to position via RC PWM signals. Carbon fiber segments and CNC machined aircraft grade aluminum make the ARM 3.0 a robust unit. With a reach diameter of over 2 meters and ability to lift 4.5kg (10 pounds) it is a very capable ARM value. The ARM 3.0 improves on the ARM 2.0 with better position sensors, more robust linear actuators, and more powerful motor controllers.",
			"This 6 degree of freedom arm uses linear actuators and rotary servos to provide an operation envelope of over 7 ft in diameter. Sealed ball bearings provide precision movement at each joint. The lower 4 joints use absolute encoders for precise, linear control. Typical current draw at full capacity is approximately 7 amps. Rotation speed of base joint is 60 degrees / second. Wrist rotates 240 degrees in 2.3 seconds. Gripper moves from fully open to fully closed in less than 1 second. Reverse power protection and over-current protection is built into to the unit. A power switch with green LED \"on\" state indication is located on the electronics enclosure.",
			"Open-Loop Velocity Control\nAll joints in this version of the ARM operate in open-loop velocity mode. This ARM is most friendly when using a joystick or radio control unit to allow a human operator to directly control the ARM. When connected to a radio or joystick, this ARM will hold position when the joystick is centered and will begin to move as the operator moves the joystick from center. The more the joystick is moved from center, the faster the ARM will move. If the joystick is moved in the other direction, the ARM will reverse directions. This version of the ARM can run out-of-the-box by connecting 12VDC power and any standard RC radio to the input connector.",

			"The BlueRobotics Pre-Connected Lumen Subsea Light V (4pk) is a blindingly bright LED light for use on ROVs, AUVs, and other subsea applications. Using a high-efficiency Cree XLamp MK-R LED, the light outputs over 1500 lumens at 15 Watts, brighter than most car headlights! It has a 135 degree beam angle for wide illumination in front of an ROV. The color temperature is 6200K, similar to most dive lights and ROV lights.",
			"In addition to really high brightness, the Lumen R2 is designed for very low brightness output, which is important to be able to illuminate the scene without washing out the colors or brightness. An exponential brightness curve makes it intuitive to use effectively. It’s housed in a rugged hard-anodized aluminum enclosure with two cable penetrators at the rear, allowing it to go to a depth of 950m. The specially designed injection molded acrylic lens ensures a consistent beam angle in both air and water. The case has a built-in mounting bracket with two M3 threaded holes for mounting to your vehicle.",
			"The light operates on 10-48V inputs and can accept PWM signals from 3-48V! It is compatible with many common boards like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and PixHawk. The case warms up to a comfortable 55°C (131°F) when operated in air and stays much cooler in water.",
			"Note: Don’t look directly into this light to avoid any damage to your eyes.",

The shield is based around a GP3906-TLP GPS Module – a 66-channel GPS receiver featuring a MediaTek MT3339 architecture and up to a 10Hz update rate. The GPS module will stream constant position updates over a simple TTL-level serial port, which you can then log to a µSD card and/or use for other purposes.",
			"Everything on the shield is highly configurable: A switch allows you to select the GPS module’s UART interface between either hardware or software ports, the µSD card operates over a hardware SPI port, which should be compatible with most Arduino layouts, and extra prototyping space should allow you to add those last, few components you need to complete your project. The GPS Logger Shield’s main voltage supply is taken from the Arduino 5V header pin.",

It is a fully functional shop mill that fits on a tabletop and stores on a closet shelf. All Sherline mills feature precision machined dovetailed slides with adjustable gibs, permanently lubricated spindle bearings, adjustable preload anti-backlash feed screws and a high-torque 90 VDC motor with electronic speed control.

The DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250-T servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the PincherX 150 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The PincherX 150 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",

Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The PincherX 150 Robot Arm has a 45cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 90cm. The working payload for the PincherX 150 arm is 50g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the PincherX 150 can lift more than 50g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

			"The SG20 Series Servo Gearbox (3.8:1 Ratio, Continuous Rotation, 1794 oz-in, 18 RPM) utilizes the Hitec HSR-M9382TH servo that has been programmed for continuous rotation.",
			"This means that the servo driving the gearbox has no limitation to the amount of travel. The signal that you send to the servo will determine the speed at that the servo rotates.",
			"It is bidirectional and fully proportional, meaning that you can vary the speed and direction with the signal being sent from your servo controller.",
			"This 3.8:1 ratio model will result in the large aluminum gear spinning a little more than one fourth the speed of the original servo, but with nearly four times the torque!",
			"The 1/2\" diameter stainless steel shaft of the Servo Gearbox is supported by a pair of 1/2\" ball bearings and held in place with retaining rings above and below the bearings so that it can withstand loads from any direction.",
			"The Servo Gearbox is easily attached to the Actobotics Channel, given it is overall width of 1.32\" (to match the internal width of the U-Channel). For those of you installing in an R/C vehicle, the 585506 bracket is a popular choice as it creates ears to mount the servo gearbox down to a flat surface.",
			"This model is programmed for continuous rotation, you can actually toggle back and forth between continuous (open loop) and feedback (closed-loop) mode, using the Hitec DPC11 servo programmer and BLDC Ver 3.1 firmware.",
			"Given the 3.8:1 ratio, when programmed to feedback mode, the gearbox is capable of up to 1.8 turns and the speed will be 0.53 sec/60°.",

Overall, the four-finger SoftGripper is forgiving when positioning the item, and the design prevents slippage by simply re-gripping the object in the new position. You can insert a suction cup into the socket between the fingers and use both, finger and suction cup for handling. Note that they have separate pneumatic inputs.",
			"SoftGripper universally suitable for all pick-and-place applications",

Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset.",
			"And best of all, it's a Feather - so you know it will work with all FeatherWings! What a great way to quickly get up and running. The most exciting part of the Feather M4 is that while you can use it with the Arduino IDE - and it's bonkers fast when you do, it is shipped with CircuitPython on board.",
			"When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with main.py on it. Edit main.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can't install software on. When you're done, unplug the Feather and your code will go with you.",
			"The Feather M4 Express uses the extra space left over to add a Mini NeoPixel, 2 MB SPI Flash storage and a little prototyping space. You can use the SPI Flash storage like a very tiny hard drive. When used in CircuitPython, the 2 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files.",
			"When used in Arduino, you can read/write files to it, like a little datalogger or SD card, and then with our helper program, access the files over USB. Easy reprogramming: the Feather M4 comes pre-loaded with the UF2 bootloader, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython or Arduino IDE (it is bossa-compatible). Comes fully assembled and tested, with the UF2 USB bootloader.

			"One of the limitations of I2C, on which Qwiic is based, is that some sensors only have one or two changeable bits in their address. Some even have a single fixed address. That means that you can't use more than one of them connected to the same I2C bus on your microcontroller. What if you want to use more than one? Thanks to the handy-dandy Zio Qwiic MUX, you can use up to EIGHT of that fixed-address TOF range-finder module that you want to stick on every side of your drone for automatic collision avoidance. Your shattered dreams of building an I2C-based motion capture suit using BNO080 breakouts? Shattered no more, my friend. We've got your sixteen sensors right here.",
			"What's the trick? The TCA9548APWR is an eight-channel two-wire bus multiplexer. It is, in fact, an I2C device itself. By changing the value of one of the TCA9548APWR's registers, you can route the connection from your MCU to any of eight pairs of pins, each with their own set of pullup resistors (optional, via solder jumpers), on the other side of this IC. It's a lot like a railroad track switch. Want to know what else is cool about that? It overcomes the 4-foot wire-length limitation of Qwiic. Each one of those ports counts as a different bus.",
			"We don't do any voltage level shifting on these ports. Each and every one is an unadulterated 3.3v Qwiic port. The TCA9548APWR also has three configurable address bits, so you can use up to eight of them on the same bus. Or you can get really crazy and connect eight other Zio Qwiic MUX boards, all with the same address, to each of the eight ports on your first Zio Qwiic MUX. And then… well, exponents being what they are, you could split your one I2C bus into over sixteen million of them using only these boards. That is, if you had the money and space and inclination. Frankly speaking, we don't recommend it. But if you want to place an order for the two million or so boards necessary to do it, we could probably work out some kind of volume discount for you. Just don't ask us to offer a power supply solution for that.",

			"The Sherline 5800 Series 18-Inch NexGen Milling Machine Package A (Metric) is a new generation of vertical milling machine from Sherline. With the increase of popularity of Sherline mills in industrial, laboratory and school training environments, the need to produce larger parts has led to the development of an extended capacity milling machine.",
			"Standard Features",
			"Extra-rigid Column Base—To take maximum advantage of the extended column travels on this extra capacity Sherline mill, the column base has been increased in cross-section for additional rigidity. The ability to swing the column arm from side to side has been eliminated in order to maximize the column’s ability to maintain its position during heavy cuts. The column still rotates left and right 90° and the in/out adjustment is still available, giving it seven directions of movement including X, Y, Z, and headstock rotation on the column itself.",
			"15″ Extended Column Bed",
			"The standard 11″ column with 5.38″ of Z-axis travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 15″ column that provides 9.38″ of vertical movement for use on larger parts or taller set-ups.",
			"18″ Extended Mill Table",
			"The standard 13″ mill table with 8.65″ of travel has been replaced with Sherline’s optional 18″ table that provides 13.65″ of X-axis travel.",
			"18″ Mill Base",
			"The standard 14″ mill base has been replaced with an 18″ base that provides an additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. This is made more usable with the inclusion of a P/N 1297 mill headstock spacer block that adds an additional 1.25″ of throat distance to take advantage of the additional travel.",
			"7″ x 13″ Tooling Plate",
			"The included tooling plate makes holding parts easy. It has three T-slots as well as a pattern of drilled and tapped 10-32 holes for use with clamps and hold-down sets. Once the plate is squared with the mill, steel alignment pins speed up the process of making sure your parts and fixtures are also square with the mill.",
			"Y-axis Leadscrew Protection",
			"Clear plastic accordion way covers protect the front half of the Y-axis leadscrew from chips. The covers are extra long to accommodate the additional 4″ of Y-axis travel. In addition, a longer 12″ brass tube extending through the column base protects the rear half of the leadscrew from chips.",
			"Other Standard Features",
			"Include oilers on the X-, Y- and Z-axes to keep the column leadscrew and base saddle leadscrews and ways lubricated during extended CNC operations. In addition, backlash is adjustable on X-, Y- and Z-axes. Adjustable tapered plastic gibs provide a way to accommodate wear on the aluminum and steel dovetailed slides on all three axes.",

			"VSA provides a graphical timeline of events. Events define a change in position (e.g., a servo) or value (e.g., a stage light dimmer). These colored events can be created consecutively to cause action for one device or created simultaneously for different devices to create a complex series of synchronized movements.",
			"The start and stop values are depicted visually. While events allow motion to be scaled and adjusted as a group, the plot view allows individual start and stop values to be edited. From the plot view, the amplitude of the event values (i.e., servo position or dimmer value) can be adjusted with a quick drag and drop operation. Events can also be matched with the graphically depicted wave/MP3 and AVI files, greatly simplifying DJ lighting and animatronic lip sync.",
			"Timeline events specify servo speed, relay position, and dimmer fade. Every animator has faced the challenge of sending commands in small step increments to produce the illusion of a variable servo or dimmer. Realizing that variable control is a necessity in any show production, VSA events are defined by a start and a stop value. When VSA encounters an event during playback, it automatically interpolates between the start and stop values to create a smooth motion or fading effect.",
			"Import, mirror, and repeat events. In the course of any production, the same series of events will probably need to be repeated. VSA provides several options: first, series of events can be grouped and imported in to other routines. Second, a group of events can be highlighted and repeated any number of times. Third, an excellent technique for creating iterative motions, groups of events to be selected and then mirrored.",
			"Visually define the position of a servo and brightness of a dimmer. VSA takes the guesswork out of determining the right position for a servo or dimmer. Rather than entering an obscure integer, VSA allows you to select the right value using a virtual device. As you drag the servo's arm or increase the brightness using the mouse or joystick, real-time commands are sent to the hardware. The entire show can be scripted without programming any value or code.",
			"VSA events are edited in a drag & drop environment. VSA allows you to create and resize events by simply dragging with the mouse. As you drag, VSA draws guidelines that span the vertical axis, enabling events to be precisely aligned with the audio, video, and other events. Additionally, events can be grouped together and then moved or scaled as one -- allowing complex actions to be quickly modified as a whole.",
			"Playback is animated and supports the use of multiple sound cards. As you begin to refine your routines, you will find the playback capabilities of VSA impressive. As VSA plays the routine, a play bar marks the current position -- showing you exactly which events are being executed and allowing you to halt or pause playback. VSA even helps you fine tune portions by providing markers that enable you to playback small parts of a routine. During playback, VSA can also output different audio files to multiple sound cards and different video streams to different monitors. For example, each animated character in a skit could have its own USB sound card and speakers.",
