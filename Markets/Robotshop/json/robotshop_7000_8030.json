The eyes can pan and tilt, eye cover and mouth can close and open independently, and the neck can pan and tilt too.",
			"This system is fully integrated and tested. The technology behind such system evolved from Dr Robot's Distributed Computation Robotic Architecture which was originally developed for Dr Robot Humanoid Robot. Through the integrated high bandwidth (11Mbps) WiFi 802.11 wireless module, the system can upload all the sensor information including the rotary sensor readings to your home PC at over 20Hz rate and streams audio (8Hz x 8bits) and video (up to 4 fps) to your home PC for your high level AI schemes to process. Your control commands are sent down to this mobile system at real-time via the same wireless link at a rate of 10-50Hz. With the supplied WiRobot development software components (for MS Windows 2000 and up), you get access to all these data information in standard Microsoft Windows programming environment (e.g. MS VB and VC++). With such approach, you have no limit on mobile system processing power, memory and storage any more. For users of non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux), Dr Robot will provide the raw communication protocol for direct integration with any other system/device.",
			"With such system, you could develop your own intelligent robotic assistant, security robot or simply use it as a platform for your projects like human-machine interaction, mobile system navigation, robot behavior, image processing, object recognition, voice recognition, tele-operation, remote sensing, map building and localization etc.",

The DYNAMIXEL XM540-W270 & XM430-W350 servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the ViperX 300 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The ViperX 300 offers 6 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",

Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The ViperX 300 Robot Arm has a 75cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 150cm. The working payload for the ViperX 300 arm is 750g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the ViperX 300 can lift more than 750g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

The sensor interprets the echoes returning to it, and from this detects objects in the path of the sensor. Using the app interface, you can program the robots you build to behave based on the feedback coming from the ultrasound sensor.",
			"Build a humanoid robot that walks forward on two legs and pivots to avoid obstacles in its path. An awesome stag beetle model moves backwards or forwards in response to an obstacle, and opens and closes its pincers. Construct a funny crocodile model that wags its tail if no object is in sight, but then opens its giant jaws when an object approaches. Using an additional smartphone and tablet, you can even hack together a cute little spy-bot that roams around and streams video back to the tablet screen. A cool dual-rotor drone model rotates its rotor blades 90 degrees. You can also assemble other fun robots including a robo-dog and robo-dino. After you have learned how the technology works, you can build and program your own robots using the kit’s 230 building pieces.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",

The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position.

If one of the sub-module I/O channels is driven LOW, that's where the line is.",
			"There are four potentiometers to independently adjust the IR modules' sensitivities to suit different robot platforms, accounting for differences in sensor mounting heights. There are four LEDs that provide a visual indicator for the detection status of each channel, which makes it easy to tune the sensitivity of each sensor channel.",
			"Because the PCA9539A has 16 digital I/O channels, we've broken out the other 12 channels to standard-pitch pin-headers so you can take advantage of them as you see fit.",

			"The Mobile WidowX 200 Robot is identical to the WidowX 200 but has a smaller form factor base making it easy to mount on a mobile platform, such as the Turtlebot. The mobile WidowX 200 does not come with CM9.04c or a 12v5a power supply. All of the X-Series arms can be modified with the lower profile base. The arm features the X-Series actuators offer higher torque, more efficient heat dissipation and better durability all at a smaller form factor over previous DYNAMIXEL servos. The DYNAMIXEL XM-430-W350T & DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250-T servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. The WidowX 200 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",
			"The WidowX 200 Robot Arm has a 55cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 110cm. The working payload for the WidowX 200 arm is 200g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the WidowX 200 can lift more than 200g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

			"The Analog Discovery Pro 3000 Series Portable High Res Oscilloscopes provide the utility of professional benchtop equipment with the flexibility of a portable instrument. With the ADP3450, every listed feature is an included feature, making it an investment that will last - at a price without surprises.",
			"With myriad choices available for test and measurement devices, adding to your benchtop can be a daunting task, especially sorting through which features on your new instrument are included versus what you'll need to pay extra for.",
			"The ADP3450 and ADP3250 are the first in the line of Analog Discovery Pro devices and take the analog and digital instruments from the internationally popular Analog Discovery and turn up key functionalities to meet the growing need for professional-level home electronics test benches.",
			"At the heart of each device is a four or two-channel high-resolution oscilloscope, offering 14-bit resolution at up to 0.5 GS/s. Additionally, to meet the needs of an increasingly digital world, 16 dedicated digital channels make the Analog Discovery Pro a true mixed-signal oscilloscope.",
			"With the included digital power supply, digital outputs, two-channel arbitrary waveform generator, and two dedicated external triggers the Analog Discovery Pro come with 12 instruments ready to analyze mixed-signal systems through our free software, WaveForms.",
			"Linux Mode: Whether at home or in the lab, engineers are routinely asked to design and validate increasingly complex systems and decrease design cycle time. Using flexible test equipment that can research, validate, and the test is one of the ways engineers can expedite this process.",
			"In addition to the 12 built-in instruments enabled by WaveForms, the Analog Discovery Pro introduces Linux Mode. Linux Mode provides an on-device terminal-based operating system that, when combined with WaveForms SDK, is a flexible starting point for all kinds of custom tests and applications.",
			"Running embedded on the device itself or via WaveForms, engineers and measurement enthusiasts alike can take advantage of data streaming via ethernet, and the on-device storage to capture buffers of millions of samples.",
			"Advanced Trigger Modes: Whether in Linux Mode using WaveForms SDK or in Standard Mode connected via WaveForms, the Analog Discovery Pro features a variety of advanced triggering options.",
			"Instruments within WaveForms can be cross-triggered for example, activating an oscilloscope capture based on a received and decoded digital protocol.",
			"And external signals can trigger events using the two dedicated external trigger inputs on the back of the device. WaveForms provides these features configurable in the instruments themselves, or for more control or automation in one of the available scripting interfaces.",

			"The DDP155 Pan System (for Hitec) is perfect for the rotation of cameras or sensors on a flat surface. This system is slightly shorter than a soda can. One of the biggest problems with servos is they can not always handle a heavy side load even though they have the power to rotate your attachment. The system can even make the $9.00, nylon geared HS-311 servo an extremely rigid panning platform.",
			"As you can see from the pictures and schematic, this system mounts the servo away from the ABS top plate via 4 aluminum standoffs. By incorporating an external ball bearing in the ABS plate ensures that whatever the servo is set to rotate will be extremely rigid side to side. Once mounted, simply use the 1/4” bore clamping hub to assist in attaching your camera or sensor to the ball bearing supported shaft. The kit comes with a 4.25” diameter, 1/4” thick ABS top plate. The plastic can be easily drilled or tapped for various needs. Kit includes all hardware and detailed instructions.",

			"Mechanics",
			"The Sputnik3 is the result of extensive efforts to develop a robot that would be fast and strong, while itself remaining lightweight and nimble. The wheel-based platform's two 12V DC motors with Integrated 800 Count per Cycle Optical Encoder each supply 40kg.cm of torque to the i90's 18 cm (7 in.) wheels, yielding a top speed in excess of 0.75 m/s. Weighing only 8 kg (18 lb.), the system is light, but it can carry an additional payload of 10 kg (22 lb.). (Optional 40 Kg)",
			"Sensors",
			"Sputnik3 offers full WiFi (802.11G) wireless, multimedia, sensing and motion capabilities and comes with a wide range of sensor, camera, and audio modules, sufficient to serve in any variety of applications. The Sputnik3 offers broad expandability as well for projects that may require additional sensors, even specialized modules. Powered by separate RC servo motors, the integrated camera head can pan and tilt independently.",
			"Architecture",
			"The Sputnik3 's underlying technology evolved from Dr Robot's Distributed Computation Robotic Architecture, originally developed for Dr Robot's Humanoid (HR) Robot. Using this approach, high-level control of the robot is maintained by a remote or local PC/server communicating by a secure wireless link. Low-level functionality is managed by an onboard digital signal processor (DSP) while computationally intensive operations are performed offboard. The result is a robot that's lighter, draws less power, runs longer and is dramatically less expensive than a fully bundled or self-contained system. Moreover, since primary processing resides in a server, any hardware upgrades to the central unit are shared by all the robots it controls.",
			"With its integrated high bandwidth (54Mbps) WiFi 802.11G wireless module, the system can upload all sensor data to a PC or server at rates in excess of 10Hz. Similarly, streaming audio and video (up to 30 fps) either for direct monitoring or for processing by high-level AI schemes is a snap. Commands and instructions sent to the Sputnik3 via the same wireless link also pass at rates exceeding 10Hz, providing real-time control and access.",
			"The Sputnik3 includes all WiRobot development software components (for MS Windows 2000 and up), enabling easy access to all data and information in a standard Microsoft Windows programming environment (e.g., MS VB and VC++). Under the approach of using a separate PC for high-level control, there are no longer onboard restrictions on a mobile system's processing power, memory and storage. For users of non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux), Dr Robot will provide the raw communication protocol for direct integration with any other system/device.",
			"With the Sputnik3 system, researchers can develop a specialized intelligent robotic assistant, security robot or simply use it as a platform for a variety of projects built around applications such as human-machine interaction, mobile system navigation, robot behavior, image processing, object recognition, voice recognition, teleoperation, remote sensing, map building and localization etc.",

			"Terrapin Logo, which is included with InO-Bot, has been optimized to smoothly interact with the robot. The Logo turtle, familiar to generations of students, has long led the way in teaching students to code by making colorful shapes and designs. With InO-Bot, the turtle jumps off the screen and follows Logo programs in space, drawing on paper or whiteboard. The Logo environment, always exciting and motivating for students, becomes even more so with an actual turtle robot running around!",
			"In addition to drawing with a pen, which can be raised and lowered through program control, InO-Bot offers many additional inputs and outputs that can be controlled and read, providing additional challenges and motivation for young coders. These include 2 LED headlights, 8 multicolor RGB running lights, sounds and notes, light, proximity sensors, and a line follower. Like Logo itself, InO-Bot makes it easy for budding roboticists to get started but continues to provide challenges to even the most experienced.",
			"InO-Bot connects via Bluetooth on Macintosh or Windows computers and may be controlled with the desktop versions of Terrapin Logo or via the online version using the Chrome browser. Terrapin Logo, which includes commands and properties to create programs for and read inputs from InO-Bot, comes with each InO-Bot. InO-Bot is powered by a USB-rechargeable battery which provides years of use.",

			"With the Zio 16-Channel 12 bit PWM controller, using the PCA9685 from NXP Semiconductors, you can control up to 16 servos or other PWM-controllable components using I2C.",
			"Each output can be off or on (no PWM control), or set any channel to its own PWM frequency and duty cycle. The PCA9685 operates with a supply voltage range of 2.3v to 5.5v and both the inputs and outputs are 5.5v tolerant. Servos can be connected directly to output pins (up to 25 mA, 5.5v) or controlled with external drivers for more power-hungry applications.",
			"The board comes equipped with two Qwiic connectors to enable easy daisy-chaining. Need even more channels to control something like a hexapod robot? Quickly and easily connect another servo controller with the additional Qwiic connector and 6 solder-jumper configurable address bits. That means you can have up to 62 of these boards operating on the same I2C bus. You can also configure the boards to recognize group addresses, so that multiple boards can be controlled in parallel with a single command.",
			"This is a derivative of Adafruit's 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface - PCA9685, with the main difference being the addition of the Qwiic connectors. If you want to make Qwiic a regular part of your hardware hacking/making toolkit (we can't image why you wouldn't), this is the Servo Driver for you.",

			"The ViperX 250 Robot Arm belongs to a new family of arms from Interbotix featuring the DYNAMIXEL X-Series Smart Servo Motors. The X-Series actuators offer higher torque, more efficient heat dissipation and better durability all at a smaller form factor over previous DYNAMIXEL servos. The DYNAMIXEL XM540-W270 & XM430-W350 servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the ViperX 250 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The ViperX 250 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",
			"ROS packages for Kinetic and Melodic on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and 18.04 make it easy to get started with the ViperX 250 arm. Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The ViperX 250 Robot Arm has a 65cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 130cm. The working payload for the ViperX 250 arm is 450g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the ViperX 250 can lift more than 450g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

This Infrared Scanning Rangefinder is perfect for robotic applications, but is not ideal for mapping. The UBG-05LN is able to report obstacles from 100mm to 5000mm in a 180° arc (0.36° angular resolution). Its low power consumption, 24V 150ma, allows it to be used on battery operated platforms. The UBG uses an area setting software to create a scanning zone for outputs to be triggered when an object comes within the scanning path. It has some underlying similarities to the range finders but it is intended to be used as an obstacle detection sensor only. The UBG-05LN is not like the URG or UTM laser range finders that use the SCIP protocol for communication and the UBG-05LN cannot use the SCIP 1 or SCIP 2 commands.",

			"This is a DC motor and worm gearbox combination , both 12V and 24V motor options are available.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",
			"This motor both 12V and 24V options and a hall sensor encoder, provides an ideal solution for applications requiring a high output torque from a compact device. The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position. The 8mm output shaft and output gear stage is much stronger than that of similar motors on the market, meaning that larger radial loads can be supported without causing damage to the gearbox.",

The X-Series actuators offer higher torque, more efficient heat dissipation and better durability all at a smaller form factor over previous DYNAMIXEL servos. The DYNAMIXEL XM540-W270 & XM430-W350 servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the ViperX 300 is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The ViperX 300 offers 5 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",
			"ROS packages for Kinetic and Melodic on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and 18.04 make it easy to get started with the ViperX 300 arm. Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The ViperX 300 Robot Arm has a 75cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 150cm. The working payload for the ViperX 300 arm is 750g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the ViperX 300 can lift more than 750g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

The Sputnik2 is the result of extensive efforts to develop a robot that would be fast and strong, while itself remaining lightweight and nimble. The wheel-based platform's two 12V DC motors with integrated 800 Count per Cycle Optical Encoder each supply 550oz.-inch(40kg.cm) of torque to the i90's 18 cm (7 in.) wheels, yielding a top speed in excess of 0.75m/s. Weighing only 6kg (13 lb.), the system is light, but it can carry an additional payload of 15 kg (33 lb.). (Optional 40Kg).",
			"The Sputnik2 offers broad expandability as well for projects that may require additional sensors, even specialized modules. Powered by separate RC servo motors, the integrated camera head can pan and tilt independently. With its integrated high bandwidth (54Mbps) WiFi 802.11G wireless module, the system can upload all sensor data to a PC or server at rates in excess of 10Hz. Similarly, streaming audio and video (up to 30 fps) either for direct monitoring or for processing by high-level AI schemes is a snap. Commands and instructions sent to the Sputnik2 via the same wireless link also pass at rates exceeding 10Hz, providing real-time control and access.",

Temperature measurements are pretty accurate also, with a ±1.0°C accuracy on temperatures between -40 and 85°C.",

The DYNAMIXEL XM-430-W350 & DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250 servos offer high resolution of 4096 positions and user definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positional feedback, as well as voltage levels, load, and compliance settings are user accessible as well. At the heart of the WidowX 250 6DOF is the Robotis DYNAMIXEL U2D2 which enables easy access to DYNAMIXEL Wizard software as well as ROS. The WidowX 250 offers 6 degree of freedom and a full 360 degree of rotation.",

Packages include full meshes and URDFs (including accurate inertial models for the links), driver node that controls the physical robot arm and publishes joint states as well as gazebo and moveit support. Examples are also included to show users how the core packages work.",
			"The WidowX 250 6DOF Robot Arm has a 68cm horizontal reach from center of the base to gripper with a total span of 138cm. The working payload for the WidowX 250 6DOF arm is 250g. Working payload is the weight in which the arm should not exceed under normal working circumstances and is measured by the arm's ability to repeatedly lift an object at roughly half extension without failure. While the WidowX 250 can lift more than 250g, we do not recommend payloads over this number.",

			"This is the Dr. Robot Sputnik WiFi Mobile Development Platform (w/ Head). The Sputnik has been built in response to requests for a robot that had the speed and payload of X80 with the development versatility of the DRK8080. This is a robot with the complexity expected of a research tool, but the simplicity of use required by hobbyists and enthusiasts.",
			"In addition to all the features offered in the model X80 robot, included with SPK-1 are software modules enabling remote access and control of the robot via Internet protocol. For home users, this means the ability to navigate and monitor the robot's surroundings remotely. Other software elements permit remote listening through the robot's microphone as well as two-way verbal communication through the robot to a remote user.",
			"Like its cousin the X80, Sputnik is a balance of speed and strength with portability and precision. The wheel-based platform's two 12V DC motors each supply 300 oz.-inches(22kg.cm) of torque to the robot's 18 cm (7 in.) wheels, yielding a top speed in excess of 1 m/s (3.3 ft/s). Two high-resolution (1200 count per wheel cycle) quadrature encoders mounted on each wheel provide high-precision measurement and control of wheel movement. Weighing only 6.1 kg (13.5 lb.), the system is light, but it can carry an additional payload of 10 kg (22 lb.)",
			"The Sputnik offers full WiFi (802.11g) wireless, multimedia, sensing and motion capabilities and comes with a wide range of sensor, camera, and audio modules, sufficient to serve in any variety of applications. The robot offers broad expandability as well for projects that may require additional sensors, even specialized modules. Powered by separate RC servo motors, the integrated camera head can pan and tilt independently.",

			"Proximity sensors; to sense objects in front of it. It can sense if an object is far or near. Try using it to create your own self-navigating car, or a hands-free instrument!",
			"Light sensors; Use this Bit to control your circuits with light. The amount of light shining on the sensor will change how your circuit behaves. It's a great way to activate your circuit without hands, and is perfect for alarms!",
			"Buzzers; Bzzz! The buzzer Bit makes a sound no one can ignore. Just like an alarm clock! It's great at sounding the alarm or annoying those nearby.",
			"Bargraphs; to show you how much signal the Bit is receiving with a display of 5 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in different colors. Try it with a dimmer to make your own adjustable lamp.",
			"Number bit; to display information that it receives from the Bits before it. It's a great way to measure the input from sensors or count things, like the score in a game.",
			"Long LEDs; offering a flexible lighting option. It is called the \"long\" LED because the light is connected to the board by a cable, which lets you put the light in some interesting places. One of our favorite tricks is to place the LED in the middle of a foam ball to make it glow!",
			"As well as, it comes with 20 DC motors and splits and 30 wires.",
			"The DC motor rotates a small cross axle shaft you can attach anything to. It also works with all littleBits accessories that have cross axle openings. Try attaching a wheel! Use it to spin, turn, twist, and roll.",
			"The split lets you connect a single Bit to 2 others. If you place an input before the split, it will control the 2 outputs at once, like a single light sensor controlling 2 motors (to spin car wheels!). The flexible wires on the split also allow you to place your Bits farther apart and position them how you like.",
			"The wire Bit has a flexible wire running between its 2 bitSnaps. This allows you to place your Bits farther apart from each other, turn corners, and make connections that can twist, turn, and spin.

Using the library, you can also read the raw voltage of your LiPo battery's output. And because this is a Qwiic device, your MCU can check this information even if your battery and Battery Manager board are all the way at the other end of your daisy-chain of Qwiic modules. And if your Power Module is close to your MCU, just connect the GPOUT interrupt pin to one of your MCU's GPIO pins to get a heads-up when the tank is running low. And because of the built-in current-sensing resistor circuit, you can even measure your project's real-time current consumption.",

			"Linux Mode: Whether at home or in the lab, engineers are routinely asked to design and validate increasingly complex systems and decrease design cycle time. Using flexible test equipment that can research, validate, and the test is one of the ways engineers can expedite this process.",
			"In addition to the 12 built-in instruments enabled by WaveForms, the Analog Discovery Pro introduces Linux Mode. Linux Mode provides an on-device terminal-based operating system that, when combined with WaveForms SDK, is a flexible starting point for all kinds of custom tests and applications.",
			"Running embedded on the device itself or via WaveForms, engineers and measurement enthusiasts alike can take advantage of data streaming via ethernet, and the on-device storage to capture buffers of millions of samples.",
			"Advanced Trigger Modes: Whether in Linux Mode using WaveForms SDK or in Standard Mode connected via WaveForms, the Analog Discovery Pro features a variety of advanced triggering options.",
			"Instruments within WaveForms can be cross-triggered for example, activating an oscilloscope capture based on a received and decoded digital protocol.",
			"And external signals can trigger events using the two dedicated external trigger inputs on the back of the device. WaveForms provides these features configurable in the instruments themselves, or for more control or automation in one of the available scripting interfaces.",
