Also, because there’s no moving contacts, solid state relays can be switched much faster and for much longer periods without wearing out.",

To change the mode, all you have to do is open up the case on the receiver and remove the jumper that connects 2 pins together and place it on just 1 pin, then you need to remove the power to the remote receiver and then apply the power again, this resets the system.\n\nTo program more remotes you have to press and hold the button on the circuit board, you will have to open the case first. Hold the button for a few seconds until the red LED flashes. Then press any button on each of the remotes you want to program, 1 at a time, so if you have 4 remotes you need to program all the remotes, even if they were already programmed, and just press any one of the 4 buttons on each remote. Then remove the power from the receiver and plug it back in again. Now all remotes should work with the receiver. It is suggested to use a 5 amp fuse to protect the remote system.",

With the base mounted square to the mill table, parts mounted to the tilted table can be machined or drilled at precise angles. It can be set at any angle from 0° to 90°. The hole pattern in the table accepts Sherline's mill vise and rotary table. A threaded chuck mount is also included, which means parts from the lathe can have machining operations done on them without removing them from the chuck. They can then be put back on the lathe for further operations without re-centering.",
			"With the rotary table mounted to the table and tilted, many additional machining possibilities are opened up. The pre-drilled and tapped hole pattern is laid out so that when the rotary table is rotated to the 90° position, its center is the same height as the right angle adjustable tailstock P/N 3702. This eliminates the need for the P/N 3701 right angle attachment.",

			"Actuonix's unique line of Miniature Linear Actuators enables a new generation of motion-enabled product designs, with capabilities that have never before been combined in a device of this size. This small linear actuator is a superior alternative to designing with awkward gears, motors, servos and linkages. The first member of the L series, the L12, is an axial design with a powerful drivetrain and a rectangular cross section for increased rigidity.

			"This is the Phidgets Thin Force Sensor. With paper-thin construction, flexibility and force measurement ability, this Thin Force sensor can measure force between almost any two surfaces, up to 2 kg. To ensure the most accuracy, a small disc (included) can be placed directly on the sensing pad before applying force to the disc. This will ensure that all the force is applied directly to the sensing pad and not to the surrounding surface. The longer the object rests on the sensing pad, the more the SensorValue will drift and increase slowly in value. It is very difficult to compensate for the drift since different constant forces will produce different drift rates. For this reason, the average accuracy of this sensor is within 10% of the true value. This Phidgets Thin Force Sensor comes packaged with a 60cm Sensor Cable and 2 Rubber discs (Diameter: 12.7mmm; Height 2m). This sensor connects to an Analog Input on the: Phidgets Sensor Interface Kit 8/8/8 , PhidgetInterfaceKit 8/8/8 w/6 Port Hub (1019), PhidgetSBC (1070) and PhidgetTextLCD (1203).",

The low-profile robot is less than 10 cm × 10 cm—small enough to qualify for Mini Sumo. No soldering or assembly is required; just add 4 AA batteries and a USB cable and your Zumo is ready for programming.",

A USB A to Micro-B cable (not included) is required for programming. For advanced users who want to customize or enhance their robots with additional peripherals, the robot’s power rails and microcontroller’s I/O lines can be accessed via 0.1″-spaced through-holes along the sides and front of the main board.",
			"The Zumo 32U4 features two H-bridge motor drivers and a variety of integrated sensors, including a pair of quadrature encoders for closed-loop motor control, a complete inertial measurement unit (3-axis accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer), five downward-facing reflectance sensors for line-following or edge-detection, and front- and side-facing proximity sensors for obstacle detection and ranging. Three on-board pushbuttons offer a convenient interface for user input, and an LCD, buzzer, and indicator LEDs allow the robot to provide feedback.",

When the sensor is stretched to 150% of its original length (6\" X 150% = 9\"), its resistance will approximately double to 2.0 Kohms per inch.\n\nThe stretch sensor is a new way to measure stretch, displacement and force. The sensor is a flexible cylindrical cord with hook electrical terminals at each end.

			"The Banebots Wheels were conceived for absolute versatility. They are constructed with a thermoplastic rubber tread bonded to a black polypropylene core making them light weight and durable while providing excellent traction. The variety of sizes and mounting options make it easy to find the wheel (or combination of wheels) that meets your needs. These wheels offer a low cost solution that is durable enough for a combat robot yet still light enough to be practical. These wheels can be used both indoors and outdoors and are maintenance free.",
			"Standard low profile hubs and bushings are available supporting shaft sizes from 2mm up to 1/2\" in both drive wheel and caster applications. Wheels can be mounted one, two, or even three wide. Mounting two or three wheels to the same hub gives the flexibility of creating wider tread or mixing different durometers. The hubs and bushings (not included) offer even more versatility, allowing you to connect to metric (2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 6mm) and imperial (1/8\", ¼\", 3/8\", ½\") shaft sizes.",

			"The Cubelets Curiosity Set lets you build, learn, and create more with the Cubelets. Open a box of little robot blocks that will intrigue, fascinate, and inspire builders for hours on end. You’ve never seen building blocks like these.",
			"Cubelets make it easier than ever to explore robotics, coding, and other big ideas. Toys shape how children think about the world. So these toys are designed to inspire at home, and in the classroom, museum, camp, or club. Cubelets robot blocks make it easy for builders of nearly any age to imagine, craft, and invent countless robot constructions.",

			"Cubelets’ magnetic faces make them simple to snap together and pull apart. Connect at least one SENSE, THINK, and ACT Cubelet to create a robot construction.",
			"Build hundreds and hundreds of robot constructions with the Cubelets Curiosity Set. Visit the Create with Cubelets page for tutorials, sample, robots, and more. The Bluetooth Hat pairs robot constructions with mobile devices.",
			"Simple, proximity-based pairing makes connecting easy. Cap your creations with the Bluetooth Hat to add new abilities using the free Cubelets app. The Cubelets app is your portal to the software blocks inside each Cubelet.

To compute the counts per revolution of the gearbox output shaft, multiply the gear ratio by 12.
