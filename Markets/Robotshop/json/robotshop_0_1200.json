			"The Lynxmotion SSC-32U USB Servo Controller is the latest version of the very popular SSC-32 servo controller board. It has a USB port, an Xbee socket, improved power circuit, and a many other improvements.",
			"Lynxmotion SSC-32U Servo Controller\nThe Lynxmotion SSC-32U Servo Controller is a small preassembled servo controller with some big features. It has high resolution (1uS) for accurate positioning, and extremely smooth moves. The range is 0.50mS to 2.50mS for a range of about 180°. The motion control can be immediate response, speed controlled, timed motion, or a combination. A unique \"Group Move\" allows any combination of servos to begin and end motion at the same time, even if the servos have to move different distances. This is a very powerful feature for creating complex walking gaits for multi servo walking robots. The servo's position or movement can be Queried to provide feedback to the host computer.",
			"There is even a 12 servo Hexapod sequencer built in. This allows complete control of all aspects of the alternating tripod gait simply by transferring a few values from the host controller. Any output pin can be used as a TTL level output. There are 8 analog inputs pins for reading sensor values, and 6 of them can be used as static or latched digital inputs, so you don't have to worry about missing a short event.",
			"The new SSC-32U board has improved power and communication management. The board still has three terminal blocks, but the new power circuit means that most of the time you will only need to use VS1. With the new board, the logic circuits have large capacitors to protect against brownouts, and the logic has auto power select so the VL=VS1 jumper isn't needed anymore. For communication, in addition to having USB on-board, the SSC-32U has an Xbee socket for easy use with wireless devices such as XBees and Bluetooth.",
			"Features:",
			"SSC-32 Servo Sequencer Utility (created using FlowBotics Studio)",
			"The Lynxmotion SSC-32 Servo Controller board can be easily controlled with the new SSC-32 Servo Sequencer Utility. It is available as a free downloadable utility which makes it easy to experiment with robotics and animatronics. It can be found in the Useful Links section.",

			"The Charmed Labs Pixy 2 CMUcam5 Image Sensor features a smaller, faster and more capable than the original Pixy.",
			"Pixy 2 can learn to detect objects that you teach it, just by pressing a button.  Additionally, it has new algorithms that detect and track lines for use with line-following robots.  The new algorithms can detect intersections and “road signs” as well. The road signs can tell your robot what to do, such as turn left, turn right, slow down, etc.",
			"Wider field-of-view",
			"The new version 2.1 has an 80 degree field-of-view and offer a larger field of view. There is some spherical distortion with the new lens, which comes with the wider field-of-view.",
			"Replaceable lens and Adjustable focus",
			"The M12 lens mount allows you to substitute a different lens and has an adjustable focus that allows focusing on objects at practically any distance, including as close as 0.25 inch.",
			"Less chromatic distortion and Less pixel noise",
			"The new lens has virtually no chromatic distortion at the edges, whereas the previous Pixy version had measurable chromatic distortion.",
			"Also, the new lens has an F-stop of 2.0 vs the previous lens which had an F-stop of over 3.0. This means better light gathering ability, more signal and less noise for a given amount of ambient light. Less noise means better detection accuracy for this new Pixy version.",
			"If you want your robot to perform a task such as picking up an object, chasing a ball, locating a charging station, etc., and you want a single sensor to help accomplish all of these tasks, then vision is your sensor. Vision (image) sensors are useful because they are so flexible. With the right algorithm, an image sensor can sense or detect practically anything.",
			"But there are two drawbacks with image sensors: 1) they output lots of data, dozens of megabytes per second, and 2) processing this amount of data can overwhelm many processors. And if the processor can keep up with the data, much of its processing power won’t be available for other tasks.",
			"Pixy2 addresses these problems by pairing a powerful dedicated processor with the image sensor. Pixy2 processes images from the image sensor and only sends the useful information (e.g. purple dinosaur detected at x=54, y=103) to your microcontroller. And it does this at frame rate (60 Hz). The information is available through one of several interfaces: UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, or digital/analog output. So your Arduino or other microcontroller can talk easily with Pixy2 and still have plenty of CPU available for other tasks.",
			"60 frames per second",
			"What does “60 frames per second” mean? In short, it means Pixy2 is fast. Pixy2 processes an entire image frame every 1/60th of a second (16.7 milliseconds). This means that you get a complete update of all detected objects’ positions every 16.7 ms. At this rate, tracking the path of falling/bouncing ball is possible. (A ball traveling at 40 mph moves less than a foot in 16.7 ms.) If your robot is performing line following, your robot will typically move a small fraction of an inch between frames.",
			"Purple dinosaurs (and other things)",
			"Pixy2 uses a color-based filtering algorithm to detect objects called the Color Connected Components (CCC) algorithm. Color-based filtering methods are popular because they are fast, efficient, and relatively robust. Most of us are familiar with RGB (red, green, and blue) to represent colors. Pixy2 calculates the color (hue) and saturation of each RGB pixel from the image sensor and uses these as the primary filtering parameters.",
			"The hue of an object remains largely unchanged with changes in lighting and exposure. Changes in lighting and exposure can have a frustrating effect on color filtering algorithms, causing them to break. Pixy2’s filtering algorithm is robust when it comes to lighting and exposure changes.",
			"Seven color signatures",
			"Pixy2's CCC algorithm remembers up to 7 different color signatures, which means that if you have 7 different objects with unique colors, Pixy2’s color filtering algorithm will have no problem identifying them. If you need more than seven, you can use color codes.",
			"PixyMon lets you see what Pixy sees",
			"PixyMon is an application that runs on Windows, MacOs and Linux. It allows you to see what Pixy sees, either as raw or processed video. It also allows you to configure your Pixy, set the output port and manage color signatures. PixyMon communicates with Pixy over a standard mini USB cable. PixyMon is great for debugging your application.",
			"Controller support",
			"Pixy can easily connect to lots of different controllers because it supports several interface options (UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, or digital/analog output), but Pixy began its life talking to Arduinos. Support for Arduino Due, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black have been added.",

It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a 1.5m USB Cable Type A to B or power it with a Wall Adapter Power Supply - 9VDC 650mA or DFRobot 7.4V Lipo 2500mAh Battery (Arduino Power Jack) to get started.\n\nThe Arduino Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter. \"Uno\" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform.",
			"The Arduino Uno can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts.\n\nThe Arduino Uno can be programmed with the Arduino software. Select \"Arduino Uno from the Tools > Board menu (according to the microcontroller on your board). For details, see the reference and tutorials. The ATmega328 on the Arduino Uno comes preburned with a bootloader that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.",

			"The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.",
			"The power pins are as follows:",
			"Memory",
			"The ATmega328 has 32 KB (with 0.5 KB used for the bootloader). It also has 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library).",

			"5V.This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it.",
			"3V3. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA.",
			"GND. Ground pins.",
			"IOREF. This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V."

The lineup currently includes three “smart servos” which differ in maximum torque and speed, and share the same dimensions, mounting points and output spline.",
			"The servos form the core modules of the next generation Lynxmotion Servo Erector Set (S.E.S.) and a wide variety of modular brackets, mechanics and electronics have been designed around them. \"Smart\" means each servos' parameters are user-modifiable and configurable, there is sensor feedback (Voltage, Current, Temperature, Position, and RPM), built-in safety features, and although they work best when connected to a microcontroller or computer, can be used as advanced RC actuators.",
			"The custom LSS serial protocol was built upon the SSC-32 / 32U protocol and makes communicating with and configuring the servos one of the easiest and most intuitive to use.",
			"Compatible Products",
			"Note: The servo cannot be used on its own as no communication interface is included with the servo. The suggested serial interface is the LSS Adapter (USB, Arduino, Bee socket compatible), though most 5 V USB to serial adapters can be used (be sure to provide power separately). Any RC system can be used, though 6-12 V power to the LSS servo(s) should be provided separately.",

			"Sabertooth Dual 2x32A 6V-24V Regenerative Motor Driver is a dual channel motor driver capable of supplying 32 amps to two motors, with peak currents up to 64 amps per motor. It can be operated from radio control, analog, TTL serial or USB inputs. It uses regenerative drive and braking for efficient operation. A variety of operating modes including tank style mixing and automatic calibration allow most projects to work immediately out of the box.",
			"In addition to the standard operating modes, Sabertooth 2x32 features additional signal inputs and power outputs, as well as enhanced configuration options. User-defined operating modes allow for custom operation, such as switching between radio control and computer-driven inputs on the fly, emergency stops or front panel control overrides. The auxiliary power outputs can be configured to allow the Sabertooth 2x32 to operate from a power supply without a parallel battery, or automatic control of electromagnetic brakes. When combined with Dimension Engineering’s Kangaroo x2 motion control module, the Sabertooth 2x32 can be used for closed-loop position or speed control with encoder or analog feedback. The state of the driver can be monitored in real time using the USB port in any operating mode, making debugging your project faster and easier. Sabertooth 2x32 is more flexible, robust and powerful than previous motor drivers, while also being easier to use.",

			"What is FlowBotics Studio?",
			"FlowBotics Studio is a new robotics software development platform: it boasts the powerful FlowBotics Studio graphical programming language, and includes many demo robotics projects to get you started.  It can be used to control just about any robotics platform, data acquisition board, motor controller, servo board, sound card, or webcam.",
			"FlowBotics Studio includes hundreds of built-in components that allow you to interface your PC to many of the standard computer peripherals and, using the FlowBotics Studio programing language, you can quickly create new components for new hardware. You can also easily create new projects with custom GUI screens, knobs, buttons, switches, etc. that will run live from within FlowBotics Studio without needing to wait for compilation.",
			"Using the FlowBotics Studio programming language is as easy as dragging new components out of the library into the project's schematic, and making green links to connect one component's output of another one's input. FlowBotics Studio even has support for writing custom modules in Ruby, a traditional procedural language.",
			"FlowBotics Studio Demo Projects",
			"There is a growing collection of pre-made demo projects for use with your robotics hardware: the demos range from GUIs for simple interface card and sensor — that give you access to real-time analogue and digital signals — to full-blown robotics control applications — that have visual representations of your robots that can be manipulated directly with the mouse. The project calculates the inverse kinematics and moves the robot immediately.",
			"The projects also have a powerful pattern sequencer component that is used to build reusable patterns that allow you to program the gait of a walking robot within minutes or hours, instead of days or weeks.",
			"Since the demo projects are given with the source code, they can be modified to tailor a specific purpose or parts can be extracted for use in new projects, and the new demos will be available through FlowBotics updates.",
			"Graphics in FlowBotics Studio",
			"The FlowBotics Studio programming language includes a powerful graphics engine that allows you to make custom graphical objects by using standard bitmaps or by drawing your own shapes on the screen. Using this system, you can build entirely custom interfaces for your projects and integrate photographs, drawings, and graphs.",
			"Video in FlowBotics Studio",
			"Using FlowBotics Studio, you can record and playback video from your webcam and, using some of the video processing modules, can do motion detection, colour detection and facial recognition. The graphics engine you can even display live video inside your project's GUI.",
			"Audio in FlowBotics Studio",
			"FlowBotics Studio also has a powerful audio engine that allows you to record and playback sounds, and even generate some of your own. You can import WAV and MP3 files and process the audio using signal processing modules like EQ: you can even create your own synthesizer sounds using the built in oscillators and filters.",
			"Interface to the outside world",
			"FlowBotics Studio has a huge range of supported computer interfaces, from data acquisition boards, home automation, webcams, soundcards, networking, serial ports and USB devices. There are thousands of supported devices, including parts from Lynxmotion, Phidgets, Pololu, and Robot Electronics and also parts implementing standard Bluetooth, Xbee, Modbus, TCP/IP, UDP/IP, HID, RS232, RS485, CAN Bus, SPI, I2C, X10, DMX512, and other popular protocols.",

			"Robotics",
			"The serial port communication in FlowBotics Studio allows you to connect to a wide range of low-cost robots. You can use Inverse Kinematics (IK) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) modules to manage movement and create impressive interactive user interfaces to control your robot live.",
			"Digital Signal Processing",
			"By connecting to external analog I/O devices, you can stream high data rate signals directly into FlowBotics Studio. The Stream data components and DSP code component can then be used to create complex signal processing, and all this happens in real time.",
			"You can even tweak your algorithms and user interface live - while your data continues to stream. This makes the development process extremely quick as you see the effects straight away.",
			"Image Processing",
			"The FlowBotics Studio language has many video functions built in. You can easily connect to external webcams, record video to disk and perform complex tasks like motion, colour and face detection with ease.",
			"Home Automation and Security",
			"Using the X10 home automation system, you can create a completely customized home automation or alarm system.",
			"Using passive infrared sensors, check for motion and trigger lights and cameras. Use FlowBoard and the GSM module to send SMS alerts back to you if key events occur. Switch on and off appliances or lighting.",
			"Industry",
			"FlowBotics Studio is even used in industry for creating complex applications from test and measurement, SCADA, data logging, machine control and even UAVs.",
			"RobotShop App Store",
			"The RobotShop App Store is the new location to find and sell projects and modules made in FlowBotics Studio.",

			"The Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller Rev3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Arduino Mega is compatible with most shields designed for the Arduino Uno, Duemilanove, or Diecimila.",
			"The Arduino Mega can be powered via the 1.5m USB Cable Type A to B or with an external power supply. The Mega2560 differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega8U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.\n\nEach of the 54 digital pins on the Mega can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. It also has 16 analog inputs, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values).\n\nThe Arduino Mega2560 has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega2560 provides four hardware UARTs for TTL (5V) serial communication. An ATmega8U2 on the board channels one of these over USB and provides a virtual com port to software on the computer. Furthermore, it supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus; see the documentation on the Wiring website for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library.\n\nThe Arduino Mega2560 can be programmed with the free and open source Arduino IDE hrough a USB connection without needing any extra hardware thanks to its preburnt bootloader.  You can also bypass the bootloader and program the microcontroller through the Cytron USB ICSP PIC Programmer header.",
			"The Arduino Mega can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.",
			"External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.",
			"The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.",

			"The operating mode is set with the onboard DIP switches so there are no jumpers to lose. The Dimension Engineering Sabertooth Dual 25A Regenerative Motor Driver features screw terminal connectors - making it possible for you to build a robot without even soldering.\n\nSabertooth is the first synchronous regenerative motor driver in its class. The regenerative topology means that your batteries get recharged whenever you command your robot to slow down or reverse. Sabertooth also allows you to make very fast stops and reverses - giving your robot a quick and nimble edge.\n\nSabertooth has a built in 5V BEC that can provide power to a microcontroller or R/C receiver. The lithium cutoff mode allows Sabertooth to operate safely with lithium ion and lithium polymer battery packs - the highest energy density batteries available.\n\nSabertooth's transistors are switched at ultrasonic speeds (32kHz) for silent operation.\n\nApplications:",

			"The RPLIDAR A2 360° Laser Scanner is the next generation of 360 degree 2D lidars. The RPLIDAR A2 adopts low cost laser triangulation measurement system developed by SLAMTEC, and therefore has excellent performance in all kinds of indoor environments and outdoor environments without direct sunlight exposure.",
			"It can take up to 8000 samples of laser ranging per second with high rotation speed. And equipped with SLAMTEC patented OPTMAG technology, it breakouts the life limitation of traditional LIDAR system so as to work stably for a long time.",
			"The system can perform 2D 360-degree scan within a 12-meter range. The generated 2D point cloud data can be used in mapping, localization and object/environment modeling.",
			"Before leaving the factory, every RPLIDAR A2 has passed  strict testing to ensure the laser output power meets the standards of FDA Class I.",
			"The typical scanning frequency of the RPLIDAR A2 360° Laser Scanner is 10hz (600rpm). Under this condition, the resolution will be 0.9°. And the actual scanning frequency can be freely adjusted within the 5-15hz range according to the requirements of users.",
			"The RPLIDAR A2 consists of a range scanner core and mechanical powering parts which makes the core rotate at a high speed. When it functions normally, the scanner will rotate and scan clockwise. And users can get the range scan data via the communication interface of the RPLIDAR and control the start, stop and rotating speed of the rotatation motor via PWM.",
			"The RPLIDAR A2 comes with a rotation speed detection and adaptive system. The system will adjust the angular resolution automatically according to the actual rotating speed.",

The green LED on the receiver will blink when powered, and become solid when connection is established with the transmitter. Note that multiple units cannot be used in proximity as their signals will interfere with each other.",

			"The Witty Pi 3 RTC & Power Management for Raspberry Pi Board is the third generation of Witty Pi, and it is the descendant of Witty Pi 2. It adds realtime clock (RTC) and power management to your Raspberry Pi, and can define complex ON/OFF sequence with simple script. Witty Pi 3 supports all Raspberry Pi models with 40-pin header, including A+, B+, 2B, Zero, Zero W, 3B, 3B+, 3A+ and 4B.",
			"Comparing to Witty Pi 2, Witty Pi 3 uses the same RTC chip (DS3231SN) and introduces a new micro-controller (ATtiny841), which allows it to behave smarter and handle more complex situations. Thanks to the new on-board switching DC/DC converter (MP4462), Witty Pi 3 can accept up to DC 28V without adding extra heat sink, and still keeps the efficiency above 80%, which is indeed a comprehensive improvement.",
			"Witty Pi 3 Rev2 comes with the newer version of firmware (V1.03, with ID=0x23). This firmware allows setting the power cut delay to a bigger value (up to 25.0 seconds). The purpose of this update is to workaround the boot delay caused by USB boot or NOOBS.",

			"The SyRen 10A 6V-24V Regenerative Motor Driver is one of the most versatile, efficient and easy to use motor drivers on the market. It is suitable for medium powered robots - up to 30lbs in combat or 100lbs for general purpose robotics. Out of the box, the SyRen 10 can supply a single brushed DC motor with up to 10A continuously. Peak currents of 15A are achievable for a few seconds. Overcurrent and thermal protection means you'll never have to worry about killing the driver with accidental stalls or by hooking up too big a motor.\n\nWith just one SyRen driver you can control a motor with: analog voltage, radio control, serial and packetized serial. You can build many different robots of increasing complexity for years to come with a SyRen. Owning two SyRens allows you to build differential drive (tank style) robots because they can work in tandem with built in mixing. The operating mode is set with the onboard DIP switches so there are no jumpers to lose. The SyRen features screw terminal connectors - making it possible for you to build a robot without even soldering.\n\nSyRen is the first synchronous regenerative motor driver in its class. The regenerative topology means that your batteries get recharged whenever you command your robot to slow down or reverse. SyRen also allows you to make very fast stops and reverses - giving your robot a quick and nimble edge.\n\nSyRen has a built in 5V BEC that can provide power to a microcontroller or R/C receiver. The lithium cutoff mode allows SyRen to operate safely with lithium ion and lithium polymer battery packs - the highest energy density batteries available. SyRen's transistors are switched at ultrasonic speeds (32kHz), meaning no one will be able to hear your robot ninja army approaching.\n\nApplications:",

			"The AxiDraw V3/A3 Personal Writing & Drawing Robot is a simple, modern, precise, and versatile pen plotter, capable of writing or drawing on almost any flat surface. It can write with your favorite fountain pens, permanent markers, and other writing implements to handle an endless variety of applications. Its unique design features a writing head that extends beyond the machine, making it possible to draw on objects bigger than the machine itself.",
			"The AxiDraw V3/A3 is a special extended edition of the AxiDraw V3. While identical in most other aspects, it is designed for use with 11×17 inches (tabloid or ledger) and A3 size papers. It can also be used with paper of any smaller size, including cards and envelopes and US Letter or A4 paper. You can even use two pages of Letter or A4 paper, side by side. AxiDraw is an extremely versatile machine, designed to serve a wide variety of everyday and specialized drawing and writing needs.",
			"As compared to the (US Letter/A4 sized) AxiDraw V3, the AxiDraw V3/A3 has extended travel range. The AxiDraw comes with a mounting easel (board with clips) that can be used for holding paper, cards, and envelopes of various sizes. The AxiDraw V3/A3 also comes standard with AxiDraw Outrigger Feet preinstalled, for greater stance and stability while plotting.",
			"The unique design of the AxiDraw features a drawing head that extends beyond the body of the machine, making it possible to also draw on flat objects bigger than the machine itself. For example, you can set it right on top of a box to write an address or add decorations. You can even set it on top of a poster board, chalkboard, or whiteboard to draw graphics in place.",
			"The pen holder fits a wide variety of pens, including Sharpie fine and ultra-fine point markers, most rollerball and fountain pens, small-bodied whiteboard markers, and so forth. It can even hold a fountain pen at a proper angle of 45° to the paper. You can also use implements that aren't pens, such as pencils, chalk, charcoal, brushes, and many others. However, you'll get the best results with instruments such as fountain pens and rollerball pens, which do not require the user to apply pressure.",

			"Dimension Engineering BattleSwitch Radio Controlled Relay is the larger, 10A version of the popular Dimension Engineering PicoSwitch Radio Controlled Relay - DE-03 (RB-Dim-02). BattleSwitch is a relay (SPDT) switch that you toggle via hobby radio control gear. You can use BattleSwitch to quickly and easily control glow plugs, BattleBot weaponry and more. You can activate applications with voltage levels as high as 240VAC without having to know anything about microcontroller logic levels or transistors because the relay offers full electrical isolation from your receiver electronics.\n\nThe Dimension Engineering BattleSwitch plugs into a standard hobby radio control receiver as easily as a servo does. You connect the load that you want to toggle using BattleSwitch's wear resistant screw terminals. Depending on the channel you use, you will then be able to control the relay by moving your radio's control stick up or down, left or right, or another method you desire.\n\nBattleSwitch has a status LED on the bottom. The LED will light up when the relay switch is on, and vice versa. It will also tell you if your radio link is too weak by flashing repeatedly. The relay is a single pole double throw switch. Its typical lifetime is 100,000 switching cycles, depending on how heavy a load you are using.\n\nApplications:",

			"The DFRobotShop Rover V2 – Arduino Compatible Tracked Robot (Basic Kit) is a versatile mobile robot tank based on the popular Arduino Uno R3 USB Microcontroller microcontroller. The Rover uses the popular Tamiya twin motor gearbox and the Tamiya track and wheel set. The DFRobotShop Rover PCB incorporates a standard Arduino Uno (surface mount ATMega328), L293B motor driver (connected to pins 5 to 8), voltage regulator and prototyping area while contributing to the mechanical structural of the robot. The onboard voltage regulator allows the entire board to be powered using as little as 3.7V to ~9V*. \n\nImportant Note: If you are using the 4xAA battery pack, please remove the LiPo jumper located at the left rear of the board.\n\nThe board does NOT include 2mm 10pin XBee Socket .\n\nIn order to make assembly as easy as possible, solderless quick connect terminals have been included to give customers the option of crimping the wires to the motors (soldering is still preferable). The DFRobotShop Rover is compatible with a variety of shields when used at the same time as the motor driver, and is compatible with all shiels when not using the motor driver. Additional features include 2x encoder connectors connected to A0 and A1 for use with the Encoder Pair for Tamiya Twin Motor Gearbox , pinout for DFRobot Bluetooth and DFRobot APC220 RF modules as well as 6x cool blue LEDs (jumper selectable) placed around the board. \"DFRobotShop\" = \"DFRobot\" + \"RobotShop\" (a.k.a. \"DFRover\").\n\n*Note that the Tamiya Twin-Motor Gear Box included with the kit operates at 4.5V nominal. For 6V motors purchase 2x RB-Pol-202.",

			"With the VINT Hub Phidget, you can interface six devices to your computer through a single USB port. Each VINT port can perform one of four roles: Communicating with an intelligent VINT Device, reading a 0-5V Voltage or ratiometric sensor, acting as a digital output, or reading switches as a digital input. Each port has a power and ground pin, so you can also use the ports to gain access to the USB voltage supply directly. Control motors and LEDs, measure temperature or motion, or build a large scale system with many inputs and outputs.",
			"VINT Devices are 'plug and program': automatically discovered by the Phidget API with the same ease of programming you've come to expect from Phidgets. Each VINT device has a full API with functions and events to make programming a snap.",
			"Sometimes, you just need a few simple analog voltage sensors. Luckily, your collection of Phidget Analog Input sensors is not obsolete; each port on the USB VINT Hub can interface a 0-5V sensor. The VINT Port is backwards compatible with both ratiometric and non-ratiometric Phidget analog sensors.",
			"In digital output mode, a VINT port can be used to drive LEDs, relays, digital circuits, and other simple electronics. Each port is PWM-enabled, allowing you to dim LEDs to a specific brightness. Wire a switch or sensor contact directly into a VINT Port, and use the Digital Input mode to read the state of the switch. If you need more than six inputs or outputs, you can expand by attaching a VINT I/O module. For example, there are VINT digital output modules with 16 outputs, allowing 96 digital outputs on a single VINT HUB Phidget! See the \"Compatible Products\" tab for a list of modules.",

They are the same physical size as the T100 Thrusters, but the internal components are larger.",
			"The T200 Thruster w/ Basic ESC is basically a brushless electric motor, just like you’d find on an RC airplane or a quadcopter drone. The big difference is that this motor is purpose-built for use in the ocean and was designed specifically for use on ROVs, AUVs, and robotic surface vehicles. Of course, you could also use it to propel your stand-up-paddleboard or cruise around while kayaking! Its compact design fits in any project. The T200 is made of high-strength, UV resistant polycarbonate injection molded plastic.",
			"Applications\nThe T200 Thruster w/ Basic ESC is designed for various consumers and limitless applications. Students and Schools can use the T100 for educational projects or compete in competitions such as the AUVSI RoboSub and RoboBoat competitions and the MATE ROV competition. Its capable and affordable hardware make it perfect for Makers and Hobbyists, as well as Professional Users who want a high-quality thruster that performs better than many of the high-end (expensive) alternatives.",

			"The Pixy 2 CMUcam5 Image Sensor - LEGO is a fast vision sensor you can quickly \"teach\" to find objects. You can connect it directly to Arduino and other controllers.",
			"It’s great for robotics or any other application that requires computer vision. Pixy pairs a powerful dedicated processor with the image sensor and processes pictures from the image sensor and only sends the useful information (e.g. purple dinosaur detected at x=54, y=103) to your microcontroller (at a frame rate of 50 Hz).",
			"The information is available through one of several interfaces: UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, or digital/analog output. So your Arduino or another microcontroller can talk easily with Pixy and still have plenty of CPU available for other tasks.",
			"50 frames per second\nPixy processes an entire 640 x 400 image frame every 1/50th of a second (20 milliseconds). This means that you get a complete update of all detected objects' positions every 20ms. At this rate, tracking the path of falling / bouncing ball is possible. (A ball traveling at 30 mph moves less than a foot in 20ms).",
			"Color-based filtering\nPixy uses a color-based filtering algorithm to detect objects. Most of us are familiar with RGB (red, green, and blue) to represent colors. Pixy calculates the color (hue) and saturation of each RGB pixel from the image sensor and uses these as the primary filtering parameters.",
			"Pixy remembers up to 7 different color signatures, which means that if you have 7 different objects with unique colors, Pixy’s color filtering algorithm will have no problem identifying them. If you need more than seven, you can use color codes.",
			"Teach it the objects you're interested in\nPixy is unique because you can physically teach it what you are interested in sensing. Pixy can learn seven color signatures, numbered 1-7. Color signature 1 is the default signature. To teach Pixy the other signatures (2-7) requires a simple button pressing sequence.",
			"PixyMon lets you see what Pixy sees\nPixyMon is an application that runs on Windows, MacOs, and Linux. It allows you to see what Pixy sees, either as raw or processed video. It also allows you to configure your Pixy, set the output port and manage color signatures. PixyMon communicates with Pixy over a standard mini USB cable. PixyMon is great for debugging your application.",
			"Controller support\nPixy can easily connect to lots of different controllers because it supports several interface options (UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, or digital/analog output), but Pixy began its life talking to Arduino. Over the last several months support for Arduino Due, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black have been added.",

			"The Self-Tuning Kangaroo X2 Motion Controller adds self-tuning feedback motion control to your Sabertooth or SyRen motor driver. It can be used with quadrature encoders or potentiometers to provide position or speed control. It supports one or two feedback channels. Kangaroo x2 is the first self-tuning controller in its class. Instead of requiring you to measure, model and calculate the system, the controller itself will figure everything out after a few switch settings and button presses. In the time it takes to get a tasty snack, you can come back to a perfectly tuned system ready to accept your commands. Instead of requiring you to use a microcontroller to do closed loop control, Kangaroo x2 works from analog and radio control sources as well as microcontrollers and computers. You can use it to build that two horsepower R/C servo. During operation, you can command speeds, positions or combined commands like ''move to 37 inches at a speed of 4 inches per second.'' You can also have the Kangaroo x2 report back speeds and positions while it is running. A mixed mode allows for unstoppable mobile robots with differential drive or tank style steering.",

			"The Dimension Engineering SyRen 25A Regenerative Motor Driver is one of the most versatile, efficient and easy to use motor drivers on the market. It is suitable for medium powered robots - up to 50lbs in combat or 180lbs for general purpose robotics. Out of the box, the SyRen 25 can supply a single brushed DC motor with up to 25A continuously. Peak currents of 30A are achievable for a few seconds.",
			"Overcurrent and thermal protection means you'll never have to worry about killing the driver with accidental stalls or by hooking up too big a motor. With just one SyRen driver you can control a motor with: analog voltage, radio control, serial and packetized serial. You can build many different robots of increasing complexity for years to come with a SyRen. Owning two SyRens allows you to build differential drive (tank style) robots because they can work in tandem with built in mixing. The operating mode is set with the onboard DIP switches so there are no jumpers to lose. The SyRen features screw terminal connectors - making it possible for you to build a robot without even soldering.\n\nSyRen is the first synchronous regenerative motor driver in its class. The regenerative topology means that your batteries get recharged whenever you command your robot to slow down or reverse. SyRen also allows you to make very fast stops and reverses - giving your robot a quick and nimble edge.\n\nSyRen has a built in 5V BEC that can provide power to a microcontroller or R/C receiver. The lithium cutoff mode allows SyRen to operate safely with lithium ion and lithium polymer battery packs - the highest energy density batteries available. SyRen's transistors are switched at ultrasonic speeds (32kHz), meaning no one will be able to hear your robot ninja army approaching.",

While 16K is plenty for nearly all Arduino libraries, 64K allows for more advanced applications. Icons and graphics for color displays and audio effects requiring delays, like reverb and chorus, will become possible on Teensy 3.2. Flash memory has also doubled, to 256K, and provides double the memory bandwidth. Teensy 3.2 has a proper analog output. You can always filter PWM, but true analog output responds rapidly. The output is created by the stable reference voltage, so it's doesn't vary if your power supply voltage changes slightly.",

			"About the Servo Erector Set V1.1",
			"Think of the Lynxmotion series of servo brackets as a modular building set for servos. These components are extremely versatile, making virtually any mechanical arrangement possible. It's now possible to build custom robots to your specifications! The aluminum brackets are available in black anodized aluminum and when there is need for plastic, the parts are in durable black Lexan. Ball bearings at each degree of freedom provide for precise, low friction movement. The tubing, hubs and hub connectors are precision fit and really expand what is possible to build. They are made in the USA from high quality aluminum alloy. Unlike LEGO Mindstorms and many other modular robotic building kits, the Lynxmotion Servo Erector Set (SES) is bordering custom robotics as it allows you to integrate third party sensors and products.\n\nProgram It!\n\nIncluded with the SES kit is the new FlowBotics Studio (which itself includes the full version of the popular FlowStone software valued at $250!). Flowbotics Studio is an easy to use graphical, Windows - based program for programming and controlling anything you build without the need to create lines of code. FlowBotics Studio interacts directly with the SSC-32U servo controller via Bluetooth (no need for the BotBoarduino), off-loading all of the higher level mathematics to the computer. There is also a visual representation of each of the five sample robots making it easier to position the servos for each sequence.",
			"How Does it Work?\n\nYou can build an entire assembly using just the bracket components, then populate the assembly with servos using only two screws for the servo horn, and four 3mm screws, washers and nuts to secure the servo body to the bracket, which make for a very durable joint able to withstand heavy loads. This makes it surprisingly quick and easy to design and build rugged assemblies. Replacing or swapping a servo is effortless, as the rest of the assembly doesn't need to be taken apart. Configure the servos so they are properly oriented using the FlowBotics Studio software, then watch as you drag each component on the screen and the robot follows in real time! Load sample code to get the robot up and running using the PS2 controller.\n\nWhat Can You Make?\n\nAL5D Robotic Arm\n\nThe AL5D robotic arm delivers fast, accurate, and repeatable movement. The robot features: base rotation, single plane shoulder, elbow, wrist motion, a functional gripper, and optional wrist rotate. The AL5D robotic arm is an affordable system with a time tested rock solid design that will last and last. Everything needed to assemble and operate the robot is included in the kit and accessories such as a rotating wrist or vacuum gripper are sold separately.",
			"SQ3 Symmetric Quadruped Robot\n\nThe SQ3 is a 3DoF per leg quadruped robot with a symmetric body design. The robot's symmetry makes this a very unique quadruped walker. The three DOF (degree of freedom) leg design provides the flexibility required to walk in any direction as well as body roll! The robot uses eight HS-645MG servos along with four HS-422 servos. The SES kit includes everything you need to make a functional robot.",
			"MH2 Hexapod Robot\n\nThe MH2 hexapod robot is designed around a simple mechanical leg design with all metal brackets. This leg design minimizes the number of parts required to make a two DOF (degree of freedom) leg and allows this robot to be steered like a tank. Forward, reverse and in place turning is supported. The robot uses standard sized Hitec servos for the legs. The combo kit includes everything you need to make a functional robot.",
			"2WD1 Rover\n\nThe Lynxmotion Aluminum 2WD Servo Robot Kit is a robust, modifiable, and expandable chassis for your RC or autonomous robot experimentation. By utilizing plastic wheels with rubber rim, robot has excellent traction. Using our small 6V NiMH battery pack and the BotBoarduino means there is plenty of room for additional sensors and electronics. Add the IR distance sensor to the front of rear of the robot to perform basic obstacle detection.",
			"BRAT Walking Robot\n\nBRAT stands for Bipedal Robotic Articulating Transport. The robot is a 6 servo biped walker featuring three degrees of freedom (DOF) per leg. The robot can walk forward or backwards and turn in place left or right with variable speed. It can even do lots of Robo-One style acrobatic moves. Our combo kits include everything needed to make an operational robot. The electronics are mounted as a \"backpack\". Once you understand the principles, you can modify the legs to include additional degrees of freedom (such as hip rotation) or more complex motion.",

It enables a new generation of motion-enabled product designs, with capabilities that have never before been combined in a device of this size. These tiny linear actuators are a superior alternative to designing your own push/pull mechanisms.",
			"The PQ12 actuators are complete, self contained linear motion devices with position feedback for sophisticated position control capabilities, or end of stroke limit switches for simple two position automation. Driving them couldn't be easier, simply apply a DC voltage to extend the actuator, and reverse the polarity to retract it.",
			"These actuators have no built in controller, but do provide analog position feedback. While voltage is applied to the motor power pins (2 & 3) the actuator extends. Reverse the polarity and the actuator retracts. Position of the actuator stroke can be monitored using the internal linear potentiometer.",
			"This actuator offers compact miniature size and precise position feedback. It can be used for applications in robotics, consumer appliances, toys, rc vehicles, automotive, and industrial automation.",

			"The Raspberry Pi Camera Board Case w/ 1/4\" Tripod Mount is made of ultra-durable, super-glossy polycarbonate, it is both good looking and tough enough to toss into your pocket, bookbag, or toolbox. It has an easy-to-access slim opening for your camera cable to extend out from the camera module. The camera board sits nicely in the base, latching to the four little pegs, and the lid fits snugly on top. There's also a tiny hole in the lid so not to distort the capturing of images.",
			"Please note: the Pi Camera v2 (8 Megapixel) is just a bit thicker than the original, which might cause the camera to press against the case and cause blurry images, depending on how it is focused. The easiest way to fix is remove the sticky-rubber spacer that is between the camera module and PCB. Gently remove the camera module from the PCB, peel off the spacer, and replug the camera module.",

They are constructed with a thermoplastic rubber tread bonded to a black polypropylene core making them light weight and durable while providing excellent traction. The variety of sizes and mounting options make it easy to find the wheel (or combination of wheels) that meets your needs. These wheels offer a low cost solution that is durable enough for a combat robot yet still light enough to be practical. These wheels can be used both indoors and outdoors and are maintenance free.",
			"Wheels are available in various tread durometers (hardness):",
			"Standard low profile hubs and bushings are available supporting shaft sizes from 2mm up to 1/2\" in both drive wheel and caster applications. Wheels can be mounted one, two, or even three wide. Mounting two or three wheels to the same hub gives the flexibility of creating wider tread or mixing different durometers. The hubs and bushings (not included) offer even more versatility, allowing you to connect to metric (2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 6mm) and imperial (1/8\", ¼\", 3/8\", ½\") shaft sizes.",

			"The Dimension Engineering PicoSwitch Radio Controlled Relay is a relay switch that you toggle via hobby radio control gear. You can use PicoSwitch to quickly and easily control anything from a digital camera shutter to an electric squirt gun to home lighting and more. You can activate applications with voltage levels as high as 125VAC without having to know anything about microcontroller logic levels or transistors because the relay offers full electrical isolation from your receiver electronics.\n\nThe Dimension Engineering PicoSwitch plugs into a standard hobby radio control receiver as easily as a servo does. You connect the load that you want to toggle using PicoSwitch's wear resistant screw terminals. Depending on the channel you use, you will then be able to control the relay by moving your radio's control stick up or down, left or right, or another method you desire.\n\nPicoswitch has a status LED on the bottom. The LED will light up when the relay switch is on, and vice versa. It will also tell you if your radio link is too weak by flashing repeatedly.\n\nThe relay is a single pole single throw switch. Its typical lifetime is 100,000 to 1,000,000 switching cycles, depending on how heavy a load you are using. The relay is normally open when unpowered.",

			"The Wonder Workshop Dash Robot is a capable robot that can sense its environment and can be programmed wirelessly using a touch device. It is designed to be fun at your home and in a child's play room. The combination of sensors, the child friendly programming tools on touch devices, and the design of the robot makes it fun and easy for kids (and grown ups) to do several activities with robot that would have seemed impossible until now. It can move, glow, make sounds and interact with each other. This smart robot can do anything you set your mind to.",
			"Dash has two drive wheels and a balance caster that enables it to drive forwards, backwards, spin and move almost anyway you like. The 12 LEDs in the eye can be programmed independently to create patterns and animations. Dash's personality can be changed by changing the color of the side headlights, the eye animation and greetings.",
			"Visual, hands-on programming\nThe Dash is set at low floor but a high ceiling for coding. Blockly is a drag-and-drop programming language that snaps together like puzzle pieces. Start by sending simple commands, learn programming concepts as you play, and progress to creating more complex algorithms.",
			"Endless creative possibilities\nThe Dash is even more fun with add-ons. Play a song on Dashs Xylophone, take videos using the smartphone mount, and add bricks to them with Building Brick Connectors.",
			"Note: Use a supported iPad (iPad 3+, Mini, Air) to access free Wonder Workshop apps that control Dash. Limited Android support.",

			"The Benewake TFMINI-S Micro LIDAR Module I2C (12m) is a single-point ranging LiDAR based on TFmini upgrade. The blind zone is shortened to 10cm, the outdoor performance and accuracy of different reflectivity are improved, it can achieve stable, accuracy, sensitive and high frequency range detection. In addition to the low-cost, small-size, and long-ranging of the TFmini, the product itself has higher distance measurement accuracy. It is more adaptable to different outdoor environments such as strong light, different temperatures, and different reflectances.",
			"It has lower power consumption and more flexible detection frequency. The product is compatible with I2C interface. Different interfaces can be switched by commands. TFmini-S is based on TOF (Time of Flight). To be specific, the product emits modulation wave of near infrared ray on a periodic basis, which will be reflected after contacting object.",
			"The repeat accuracy of TFmini-S is directly related to the Strength value measured and the output frame rate (Frequence). The ranging repeat accuracy is characterized by the standard deviation of ranging. TFmini-S has minimized influence from external environment on distance measurement performance. Despite that, the range of distance measurement may still be affected by the environment illumination intensity and the reflectivity of detection object.",

Output from the Ping sensor is a variable-width pulse that corresponds to the distance to the target. It easily interface with BASIC Stamp and Javelin Stamp microcontrollers. A single shared I/O pin is use to trigger the Ping sensor and listen for the echo return pulse. And the  intelligent trigger hold-off allows the PING)))T to work with the BS1. An onboard three-pin header allows the PING))) to be plugged into a solderless breadboard ( for example, on a Boe-Bot ), and to be connected to its host through a standard three-pin servo extension cable.",

			"The T200 Thruster (No ESC) is a patent-pending underwater thruster designed specifically for marine robotics. Versus the T100 Thruster, the T200 is better for larger vehicles and especially for human-carrying vehicles. It’s much better suited for use on a kayak, stand-up paddleboard, while scuba-diving, or even on a small fishing boat. They are the same physical size as the T100 Thrusters, but the internal components are larger.",
			"The T200 Thruster (No ESC) is basically a brushless electric motor, just like you’d find on an RC airplane or a quadcopter drone. The big difference is that this motor is purpose-built for use in the ocean and was designed specifically for use on ROVs, AUVs, and robotic surface vehicles. Of course you could also use it to propel your stand-up-paddleboard or cruise around while kayaking! Its compact design fits in any project. The T200 is made of high-strength, UV resistant polycarbonate injection molded plastic. The core of the motor is sealed and protected with an epoxy coating and it uses high-performance plastic bearings in place of steel bearings that rust in saltwater. Everything that isn’t plastic is either aluminum or high-quality stainless steel that doesn’t corrode.",
			"Applications\nThe T200 Thruster (No ESC) is designed for various consumers and limitless applications. Students and Schools can use the T100 for educational projects or to compete in competitions such as the AUVSI RoboSub and RoboBoat competitions and the MATE ROV competition. It’s capable and affordable hardware make it perfect for Makers and Hobbyists, as well as Professional Users who want a high-quality thruster that performs better than many of the high-end (expensive) alternatives.",

Regardless of how you drive your servos, driven with an RC receiver, an Arduino board, or a VEX micro-controller, the PQ12-R servo perfectly replaces a regular servo with the added benefit of providing linear motion.",
			"The -R actuators are ideally suited to use in robotics and radio control models. They are a direct replacement for regular radio-controlled hobby servos. The desired actuator position is input to the actuator on lead 1 as a positive 5 Volt pulse width signal. A 2.0 ms pulse commands the controller to fully retract the actuator and a 1.0 ms pulse signals it to fully extend.",

			"The Actuonix Technologies L16 Actuator 140mm 35:1 6V RC Control is the big brother of L12 series and features a larger motor for increased force. These linear servos operate as a direct replacement for standard analog rotary servos. They use the same standard 3 wire connector, ground power and control. The L16 servo will function in place of a regular servo, but with the added benefit of providing linear motion. These hobby grade units are constructed using an anodized aluminum shaft, metal gearbox, steel screw and steel ball bearings.",

Brushed DC Motors are very simple to understand, but very difficult to control precisely. By applying a voltage, or pulsing a voltage rapidly, at the terminals of the motor, current flows through the motor and it will begin rotating. Depending on the direction of the current, the motor will rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. The 1065 changes the effective voltage by changing the percentage of time the full supply voltage is applied to the motor.",

You can control the IR LED and turn it on to bounce IR off objects to determine their reflectivity. White & light colored stuff will bounce the light, so you can detect it. Black & dark colored stuff will absorb the IR light so that it isn't detected. Likewise, if something isn't in the way of the sensor, it won't trigger either. Comes with a 470 ohm resistor and a 10K resistor which you can use as a pull-up resistor for the phototransistor. The sensor is breadboard friendly and easy to solder to. This works best when detecting a light-colored object approximately 5mm away - 2mm to 10mm worked fairly well but your results may vary with the LED brightness, object shininess, etc.",

As you can see from the pictures, our system incorporates 1/4” shafts supported by dual ball bearings and rigid 1/4” ABS plastic which makes it the most rigid and precise direct drive pan and tilt available. Three 1/4” holes in the top plate make it extremely easy to mount any camera or sensor. This plate can also be easily drilled to accept other attachments. The Direct Drive Pan & Tilt System can use any standard size Hitec servo. For cameras up to 1 lb, the Hitec HS-645MG Servo Motor or the HS-485HB Servo Motor servos work very well. For cameras up to 2 lbs, we suggest the Professional & Service Robots . Unit comes unassembled with full instructions.",

This well balanced ball contains 20 infrared LEDs giving full signal coverage and meets the new Robocup Jr competition requirements for the newly adopted Robocup Jr pulse modulated mode and is accredited by the RoboCup Jr Technical Committee. It can also be switched to operate in un-modulated (no pulse) mode to be compatible with existing RoboCup Jr requirements. Two additional HiTechnic modes, 1200Hz and 600Hz, provide added flexibility and detection ranges up to 5 meters or more (15+ feet). The pulse modulated IR signals make the HiTechnic Infrared Electronic Ball easier to detect in difficult background lighting conditions, a vast improvement over earlier models. The HiTechnic pulsed modes increase usable range and battery life. It is a perfect companion for the HiTechnic IRSeeker Sensor with its selectable modes tuned to the IRBall signals. This Electronic Ball is 75mm (~ 3 inches) in diameter and requires 4 AAA batteries (not included).",

Fit perfectly with GMPW and GMW plastic wheels.\n\nThis gear motor rotate 360 degrees every 1.6 seconds (just a hair slower than a servo), at 5V, drawing 600mA at stall (free running at 52mA). With a 7mm double-flat output shaft (avoid using the \"D\" output - it's not meant to take rotational load), and a built-in clutch (limiting at 60 in.oz, but easily \"locked\"), and built-in mounting screw holes, you can see why we like these motors!\n\nBased on the original design by Mark Tilden for use in the B.I.O.-Bugs (GM3 are now used for use in the Robosapien), these motors are the next generation with a variety of improvements such as dual output shafts and a lower current motor.\n\nGM3 - Gear Motors are compatible with the Solarbotics Wheel Watcher Rotation Encoder. Use it if you need to control a robot for dead reckoning, tracking odometry (distance traveled), stalled motor, or closing the feedback loop for position/velocity/acceleration.",

At the output of the gearbox, the step angle approximately 0.023°. When using the step angle in calculations, you should derive the exact step angle by dividing 1.8° by the gearbox reduction ratio. At 2.8 Amps, this stepper motor can produce a maximum torque of 960 kg-cm. However, the gearbox is only rated for 240 kg-cm of continuous torque.",

You can run them at a wide range of different voltages and it will just change the performance of the motor. We recommend that you use this motor at a minimum of 12V but you could run it at 24, or 30 if you wanted to and the motor would simply perform a bit better (require less current for a given speed and torque).",

			"The Dimension Engineering Sabertooth Dual 5A Regenerative Motor Driver is the motor driver of choice for small differential-drive robots. It is ideal for smaller robots- up to 3lbs in combat or 25 lbs for general purpose use. It is also a great choice in any application where you need to control brushed DC motors.",
			"Out of the box, the Sabertooth can supply two brushed DC motors with up to 5A each continuously. Peak currents of 10A are achievable for short periods. Because Sabertooth 2x5 incorporates soft current limiting and thermal protection, you need not worry about killing the driver with accidental stalls or by hooking up too big a motor.\n\nSabertooth allows you to control two motors with: analog voltage, radio control, serial and packetized serial. You can build many different robots of increasing complexity for years to come with a Sabertooth. Sabertooth has independent and speed+direction operating modes, making it the ideal driver for differential drive (tank style) robots and more.\n\nThe operating mode is set with the onboard DIP switches so there are no jumpers to lose or complicated programming sequences. Sabertooth features screw terminal connectors - making it possible for you to build a robot without having to solder.\n\nSabertooth is the first synchronous regenerative motor driver in its class. The regenerative topology means that your batteries get recharged whenever you command your robot to slow down or reverse. Sabertooth also allows you to make very fast stops and reverses - giving your robot a quick and nimble edge. In certain operating modes Sabertooth can process up to 3000 speed commands per second.\n\nSabertooth has a built in 5V BEC that can provide power to a microcontroller or R/C receiver. It also features a lithium cutoff mode allowing Sabertooth to operate safely with lithium ion and lithium polymer battery packs - the highest energy density batteries available.\n\nSabertooth's transistors are switched at ultrasonic speeds (32kHz) for silent operation.\n\nApplications:",

			"The Ping sonar is a multipurpose single-beam echosounder. It can be used as an altimeter for ROVs and AUVs, for bathymetry work aboard a USV, as an obstacle avoidance sonar, and more. Ping combines a compact form factor and 300-meter depth rating with an open source user interface and development libraries to create a powerful new tool for marine robotics!",
			"An echosounder, like the Ping, is one of the simplest forms of sonar. It operates by using a piezoelectric transducer to send an acoustic pulse into the water and then listens back for echoes to return. With that information, it’s able to determine the distance to the strongest echo, which is usually the ocean floor or a large object.",

Secure it to your motor shaft with the included 4-40 hex set screw.\n\nAs this wheel is drilled for a 1/8\" axle, mounting it on our GM6/7 gear motor (a 2.1mm shaft) will not quite give you a true-running wheel. You will need to create a spacer sleeve to make up the difference to make it spin true.

These tiny linear actuators are a superior alternative for designing your own push/pull mechanisms.",
			"The PQ12 actuators are complete, self contained linear motion devices with position feedback for sophisticated position control capabilities, or end of stroke limit switches for simple two position automation. Driving them couldn't be easier, simply apply a DC voltage to extend the actuator, and reverse the polarity to retract it.",
			"These actuators have no built in controller, but do provide analog position feedback. While voltage is applied to the motor power pins (2 & 3) the actuator extends. Reverse the polarity and the actuator retracts. Position of the actuator stroke can be monitored using the internal linear potentiometer.",

			"The Images Scientific 4\" Flexible Stretch Sensor is a unique component that changes resistance when stretched. When relaxed the sensor material has a nominal resistance of 1000 ohms per linear inch. As the stretch sensor is stretched the resistance gradually increases. When the sensor is stretched to 150% of its original length (4\" X 150% = 6\"), its resistance will approximately double to 2.0 Kohms per inch.\n\nThe stretch sensor is a new way to measure stretch, displacement and force. The sensor is a flexible cylindrical cord with hook electrical terminals at each end. The sensor measures 4 inches long, not including the electrical terminals, and only .060 inches diameter!\n\nApplications for the Images Scientific 4\" Flexible Stretch Sensor:",

			"The Interlink Electronics 24\" Long FSR uses a 24\" x 0.2\" rectangular pad to sense applied force. Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) are very thin, robust, polymer thick film (PTF) devices that decrease in resistance when increased pressure is applied to the surface of the sensor. FSRs are not a load cell or strain gauge devices though they have many similar properties. They are more appropriate for qualitative rather than precision measurements.",
