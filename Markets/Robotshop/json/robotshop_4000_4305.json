			"This is the Sherline Milling Vise. A milling vise is the first accessory most mill owners purchase. It will handle a large percentage of the part-holding duties when milling. It is easy to use. The most convenient way to hold small parts for milling is with the milling vise. Milling vises are different from other machine vises in that they are designed to hold the movable jaw down while clamping, eliminating any chance for the jaw to lift. It is accurately made. A cheap drill press vise is almost useless on a milling machine, because it can't be accurately aligned to the machine.",
			"The Sherline milling vise is sized just right to be the perfect working companion to the Sherline milling machine. The jaws are 2.00\" (50.8mm) wide by 1.00\" (25.4mm) deep and open a full 2.00\" (50.8mm). The fixed jaw has both a horizontal and vertical \"V\" groove to facilitate holding round bar stock. The vise includes two clamps for use in attaching it to the milling machine. These clamps are the same as the 4-jaw hold-down set (P/N 3058).",

This means that, even without a set-screw, the hub is prevented from slipping on the shaft.",

The angled peripheral rollers translate a portion of the force in the rotational direction of the wheel to a force normal to the wheel direction. Depending on each individual wheel direction and speed, the resulting combination of all these forces produce a total force vector in any desired direction.",

			"The Pololu TReX Jr 2.5A 5-24V Dual Motor Controller, a lower-power version of the Pololu TReX 13A 6-16V Dual Motor Controller , is a versatile DC motor controller designed to seamlessly blend autonomous and human control of small robots. The TReX Jr can control two bidirectional and one unidirectional motor via three independent control interfaces: radio control (RC) servo motor pulses, analog voltage, and asynchronous serial (RS-232 or TTL). Using the compact MC33887 motor driver allows for a single-board design that reduces cost while maintaining a small package. As an added benefit, the use of the MC33887 motor driver allows operation to 24 V. (For a high-power version of the TReX Jr, please consider the Pololu TReX 13A 6-16V Dual Motor Controller ).\n\nThe TReX Jr uses five input channels to receive the RC or analog control signals. When operating in RC or analog mode, the five channels function as follows:",
			"The serial interface can switch instantly with one of the other two interfaces, allowing mixed autonomous and remote control. For example, a robot could be configured to run autonomously most of the time, but a human operator could override the autonomous function if the robot gets stuck or into a dangerous situation. If the serial mode is selected as the primary interface, high-resolution measurements of all five channel input signals (be they RC pulses or analog voltages) are made available to the autonomous robot controller, allowing for complex and unlimited mixing of operator control and sensor input. For example, the Pololu TReX Jr 2.5A 5-24V Dual Motor Controller would be a great motor controller for a remotely controlled balancing robot.",
			"RC/Analog control features\nBattery Elimination Circuit (BEC) jumper lets the TReX Jr optionally power your RC receiver or analog controller. Mix-mode jumper allows for single-stick motor control of differential-drive robots automatic calibration for your particular RC or analog controller (the TReX Jr can learn the channel ranges).\n\nOptions accessable through the serial interface\nAll five high-resolution channel input values are available remapped channel input values show what the TReX Jr would do if it were in control optional 7-bit cyclic redundancy checking to ensure command/data validity calibration values can be explicitly read and set each channel can be reversed and parabolically scaled current limit, acceleration, and maximum motor speed settings the bidirectional motors can (individually) be set to coast or variable brake when in the deadband.\n\nSafety features\n\"Safe-start\" requirements prevent accidental motor activation at power-up optional automatic motor shutdown on serial error, timeout, or input channel noise.\n\nNote: The TReX Jr does not require use of the serial interface to function; it will work right out of the box as an electronic speed control (ESC). You will not have access to the full suite of features the TReX Jr provides if you do not make use of the serial interface, though.",

The sensor is small in size, yet the high output acoustic power combined with continuously variable gain, real-time background automatic calibration, real-time waveform signature analysis, and real-time noise rejection algorithms results in virtually noise free distance readings for most users. This holds true even in the presence of many of the various acoustic or electrical noise sources.

			"The Parallax Boe-Bot Robot Kit - USB Version is popular robot kit, which is available with a USB-compatible Board of Education (BOE) at no additional cost. Programming the BASIC Stamp via USB is an effective solution for laptops and newer PCs which have no serial ports (no more adapters are required). The USB driver installation instructions are available for download in useful links section. Over 90,000 Boe-Bot robots are used by hobbyists, educators and students around the world, which provides lots of feedback for improvements to this popular kit.",
			"The Andy Lindsay's Robotics with the Boe-Bot text includes 41 activities for the Boe-Bot Robotics text with structured PBASIC 2.5 source code support and bonus challenges with solutions in each chapter. Starting with basic movement and proceeding to sensor-based projects, customers quickly learn how the Boe-Bot is expandable for many different robotic projects. No previous robotics, electronics or programming experience is required while using these activities.",
			"The Boe-Bot Robot is built on a high-quality brushed aluminum chassis that provides a sturdy platform for the continuous rotation servo motors and BASIC Stamp® USB Board of Education. Many mounting holes and slots may be used to add custom robotic equipment or off-the-shelf Parallax add-ons. The rear wheel is a slider ball held in place with a cotter pin. The drive wheels are molded to fit precisely on the servo spline and held in place with a small screw.",
			"The BASIC Stamp microcontroller's flexibility of programming when coupled with breadboard circuit construction is the uniqueness of Boe-Bot unique. Along with this   the Boe-Bot users quickly learn about embedded projects, from wiring and components to programming and mechanical dependencies. The kit includes a set of passive components (wires, resistors, capacitors), sensors (photoresistors, bumpers, infrared sensors) and hardware (whisker touch-sensor kit) to complete the different projects.",
			"The Boe-Bot Robot takes about 1-2 hours to put together, though each project in the Robotics text provides a unique new experience of wiring and source code tuning. Completing the entire set of projects takes 50 hours and is suitable for anybody over 12 years of age. The USB Board of Education (and BS2-IC) may also be removed to be used as your platform for the other kits in the Stamps in Class series.",
			"After mastering the basics, Boe-Bot Robot accessories let you branch out into new activities, such as making your Boe-Bot talk with a speech board, adding infrared remote control, maze contests, line following, interfacing direction sensors, and using RF modules and video/camera equipment to build a Video-Bot. Boe-Bot accessories are all sold separately, and are available through the Robot Accessories page below.",
			"Note: Item contains a CdS cell photoresistor. The RoHS exemption request status for CdS cells is currently unclear; there are no RoHS-compliant exact replacement devices available.",
