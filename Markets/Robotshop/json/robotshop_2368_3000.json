			"The MP3 Trigger v2.4 is the Cypress PSoC CY8C29466-24SXI microcontroller which serves up MP3 data to a VLSI VS1063 audio codec IC. This version also supports an optional initialization file that can be used to set the serial port baud rate as well as to reprogram any of the 18 trigger inputs to alternate functions, including random and sequential track selection, transport controls and even volume up/down. Each conventional trigger can be set to either allow immediate restarts, or to lock out restarts if audio is playing. Also, a new trigger filename convention provides greater flexibility in naming your MP3 tracks and makes file management easier.",
			"There is also a “Quiet Mode” feature that can be enabled via the serial control port. In this mode, the trigger inputs don’t start tracks directly, but instead produce a serial message indicating which triggers were activated. A host microcontroller can thus monitor the trigger inputs and then start any track or sequence of tracks via the serial control port, making the triggers much more flexible.",

The frame has an open front, for greatly improved accessibility and visibility while you are plotting. The most common mechanical adjustments are faster with bicycle-style quick releases, and repositioned thumbscrews for easier access. And, it comes fully assembled and ready to use. Assuming that you've installed the software first, you can be up and printing within minutes of opening the box.",
			"The EggBot Pro fits spherical and egg-shaped objects from roughly the size of a gum ball to that of a light bulb about 1 to 3.5 inches in diameter (2.5 - 9 cm). Perfect for ping pong balls, golf balls, chicken eggs, and similarly sized objects. The movements of the pen and egg motors are controlled by high-torque precision stepping motors, and the pen lift mechanism is a quiet and reliable servo motor. The included EiBotBoard v2.0 (EBB) driver board uses 16× microstepping to give a resolution of 3200 steps/revolution in both axes.",
			"To operate the EggBot Pro, you will need a reasonably modern computer with an available USB port (Mac, Windows or Linux), plus internet access to download necessary software. The EggBot is normally controlled through a set of open-source extensions to Inkscape, the excellent, popular and free vector graphics program.",

These types of systems are found in many applications such as passport protection, animal identification, inventory control systems, and secure access control systems. The Phidget RFID Read-Write supports reading and writing in 3 protocols: EM4100, ISO11785 FDX-B, and PhidgetTag. The PhidgetTag protocol simply stores up to 24 ASCII characters to the tag.",

			"These Solarbotics GM2 - Gear Motors are very comparable to a hobby servo for power, at a fraction of the cost! Fit perfectly with GMPW and GMW plastic wheels.\n\nThis gear motor rotate 360 degrees every 1.6 seconds (just a hair slower than a servo), at 5V, drawing 600mA at stall (free running at 52mA). With a 7mm double-flat output shaft (avoid using the \"D\" output - it's not meant to take rotational load), With a 7mm double flat shaft and a built-in clutch (limiting at 60 in.oz, but easily \"locked\"), and built-in mounting screw holes, you can see why we like these motors! These units have an overall size of thick, while only weighing.\n\nBased on the original design by Mark Tilden for use in the B.I.O.-Bugs (GM3 are now used for use in the Robosapien), these motors are the next generation with a variety of improvements such as dual output shafts and a lower current motor.\n\nGM2 - Gear Motors are compatible with the Solarbotics Wheel Watcher Rotation Encoder. Use it if you need to control a robot for dead reckoning, tracking odometry (distance traveled), stalled motor, or closing the feedback loop for position/velocity/acceleration.",

The controller can operate in Trapezoidal mode or Sinusoidal mode with Field Oriented Control (FOC). Several sensors types are supported in order to detect the rotor position and sequence power to the motors' 3 windings in order to generate smooth continuous rotation. The controller can drive sensor less motors in trapezoidal mode.",
			"The SBL1360A accepts commands received from an RC radio, Analog Joystick, wireless modem, or microcomputer. Using CAN bus, up to 127 controllers can be networked on a single twisted pair cable. The controller's operation can be extensively automated and customized using Basic Language scripts. The controller can also be reprogrammed in the field with the latest features by downloading new operating software from Roboteq.",

			"The SF11 laser altimeter makes accurate distance measurements to solid surfaces up to an altitude of 120 meters and water up to 40 meters. Operating from a regulated 5 V DC supply, the SF11 includes analog, I2C and serial interfaces that can be easily connected to a Pixhawk flight controller or another standard processing platform.",
			"Each interface on the SF11 can be configured using a simple software menu that is accessible through the built-in, micro USB port. Settings can also be changed in situ using the command sets available for the serial and I2C ports.",

Additional features of this second-generation (G2) driver include reverse-voltage protection along with basic current sensing and current limiting functionality.",
			"The Pololu G2 High Power Motor Driver 21A, 6.5V-40V is a discrete MOSFET H-bridge designed to drive large brushed DC motors. The H-bridge is made up of one N-channel MOSFET per leg; the rest of the board contains the circuitry to take user inputs and control the MOSFETs. The absolute maximum voltage for this motor driver is 40 V, and higher voltages can permanently destroy the motor driver. Under normal operating conditions, ripple voltage on the supply line can raise the maximum voltage to more than the average or intended voltage, so a safe maximum voltage is approximately 34 V.",

The camera is supported in the latest version of Raspbian, Raspberry Pi’s preferred operating system",
			"The OV5647 Camera Board w/ LS-40180 Fisheye Lens M12x0.5 Mount for Raspberry Pi 3 itself is tiny, at around 36mm x 36mm. The highlight of module is that the Lens is replaceable compared to official one, making it perfect for mobile or other applications where size and image quality are important. It connects to Raspberry Pi by way of a short ribbon cable. The camera is connected to the BCM2835/BCM2836 processor on the Pi via the CSI bus, a higher bandwidth link which carries pixel data from the camera back to the processor. This bus travels along the ribbon cable that attaches the camera board to the Pi.",

			"This is the Sherline Mill Tooling Plate. Like those used on many of manufacturer's large production machines, the mill tooling plate solves two main problems. It not only protects your mill's table from damage (while also adding additional stiffness), but it also provides an inexpensive, modifiable surface for clamping work that is as flat as the machine's original table. The best way to hold a part more securely is to add more clamping points rather than over-tightening the points you already have. The mill tooling plate allows you to easily do this.",
			"Like a lathe faceplate, the mill tooling plate should be looked at as somewhat disposable. It has a hole pattern predrilled to make it easy to clamp down the Sherline mill vise or the rotary table, but you should feel free to drill and tap whatever additional holes are needed to meet your clamping and setup needs for a particular job. The plate is made from cast aluminum, which is accurately milled to 1/2\" thick. Though not quite as strong as extruded grades, it is very stable and free from internal stresses so it will not warp when you drill additional holes. The surface is not anodized, as it is intended to be easily drilled and machined to suit your unique needs.",

			"The Gravity Huskylens AI Machine Vision Sensor is an easy-to-use AI machine vision sensor. It is equipped with multiple functions, such as face recognition, object tracking, object recognition, line tracking, color recognition, and tag (QR code) recognition.",
			"Through the UART / I2C port, HuskyLens can connect popular main control boards like Arduino, micro:bit, Raspberry Pi and LattePanda to help you make very creative projects without playing with complex algorithms.",
			"HuskyLens is pretty easy-to-use. You can change various algorithms by pressing the function button. Click the learning button, HuskyLens starts learning new things. After that, HuskyLens is able to recognize them. Additionally, HuskyLens carries a 2.0-inch IPS screen. So, you don’t need to use a PC in the parameters tuning. Enjoy the convenience it brings, what you see is what you get.",
			"HuskyLens is designed to be smart. It has the built-in machine learning technology that enables HuskyLens to recognize faces and objects. Moreover, by long-pressing the learning button, HuskyLens can continually learn new things even from different angles and in various ranges. The more it learns, the more accurate it is. HuskyLens adopts the new generation of specialized AI chip Kendryte K210.",
			"The performance of this special AI chip is 1,000 times faster than that of the STM32H743 when running a neural network algorithm. With these excellent performances, it can capture even fast-moving objects. With the HuskyLens, your projects have new ways to interact with you or the environment, such as interactive gesture control, autonomous robot, smart access control and interactive toy. There are so many new applications for you to explore.",
			"HuskyLens' object-tracking skills can be used to learn specific gestures. It can recognize those learned hand movement patterns and feed their positions. With these data, creating awesome interactive projects are never so easy.",
			"HuskyLens can detect and follow lines. Line follower is not something new, there are plenty of excellent methods and algorithms in this scenario. However, most of them require tedious parameters tuning. This time, HuskyLens provides a new way to do line following simply click the button, then it starts learning and tracking new lines.",
			"Let's enjoy the fun of making with HuskyLens. HuskyLens can be the eyes of robots. which allows your robot to recognize you, understand your hand gesture commands, or help you put stuff in order and so on. With Huskylens, nothing is impossible.",

The design includes the ability to power the board using a LiPo battery or an external power source rated 5V. Switching from one source to the other is done automatically.",
			"It is a good 32 bit computational power similar to the Zero board with the usual rich set of I/O interfaces, global GSM communication and the ease of use of the Arduino Software (IDE) for code development and programming. All these features make this board the preferred choice for the emerging IoT battery-powered projects in a compact form factor. The USB port can be used to supply power (5V) to the board. During cellular transmissions the peak current required by the board will exceed 500mA.",

It includes 60mm aluminium mecanum wheels, four coreless 12V DC motors with encoders, Arduino 328 microcontroller board (It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller) and Arduino IO Expansion board (This sensor expansion board is able to easily connect a number of commonly used sensors).\n\nThe 4WD 60mm Mecanum wheel arduino robot kit is stable, its chassis is made of aluminum-alloy and it can be controlled to move in any direction and turn by varying the direction and speed of each wheel. Moving all four wheels in the same direction causes forward/backward movement, running left/right sides in opposite directions causes rotation, and running front and rear in opposite directions causes sideways movement. The platform rear wheels are mounted in a particular way, so that the suspension structure ensures that all four wheels can adhere to the ground, even when the ground is uneven.",

The sound detector not only provides an audio output, but also a binary indication of the presence of sound, and an analog representation of its amplitude. The 3 outputs are simultaneous and independent, so you can use as many or as few as you want at once. The envelope output allows you to easily read amplitude of sound by simply measuring the analog voltage. Gain can be adjusted with a through-hole resistor, to change the threshold of the binary (gate) output pin as well. Each of the three output signals is present on the .1\" header at the edge of the board. They are active simultaneously. If you aren't using one in your particular application, simply leave that pin disconnected.",

The sensor is a flexible cylindrical cord with hook electrical terminals at each end. The sensor measures 12 inches long, not including the electrical terminals, and only 0.060 inches diameter!\n\nApplications for the Images Scientific 12\" Flexible Stretch Sensor:",

			"The SparkFun Current Sensor Breakout - ACS723 (Low Current) is a high accuracy board that utilizes the ACS723 for moderate AC and DC current sensing applications. The ACS723 sensor uses a Hall effect sensor to output a voltage relative to the current flowing through the IP+ and IP- pins on the board. The advantage of using a Hall effect sensor, specifically, is that the circuit being sensed and the circuit reading the sensor are electrically isolated meaning that, although your Arduino is running on 5V, the sensed circuit can be operating at higher DC or AC voltages!",
			"The SparkFun Current Sensor Breakout measures both DC and AC currents all the way up to 5A, has full electrical isolation of measured and sensed circuits, and has a base sensitivity of 400mV/A. Although the analog output is adjustable to 80kHz, the bandwidth on the ACS723 Sensor Breakout width filter has been set to 20kHz to reduce noise when using at high gains. The full 80KHz bandwidth that the sensor is capable of can be recovered by closing the JP1 (Bandwidth Select) jumper on the back of the board.",

			"This is the Digital IR Line Sensor - QRE1113. This version of the QRE1113 breakout board features a digital output, using a capacitor discharge circuit to measure the amount of reflection. This tiny board is perfect for line sensing when only digital I/O is available, and can be used in both 3.3V and 5V systems. The board's QRE1113 IR reflectance sensor is comprised of two parts - an IR emitting LED and an IR sensitive phototransistor. When you apply power to the VCC and GND pins, the IR LED inside the sensor will illuminate. A 100 Ohm resistor is on-board and placed in series with the LED to limit current. The output of the phototransistor is tied to a 10nF capacitor. The faster that capacitor discharges, the more reflective the surface is.",
			"These sensors are widely used in line following robots. White surfaces reflect more light than black, so, when directed towards a white surface, the capacitor will discharge faster than it would when pointed towards a black surface. The power input and output pins are brought out to a 3-pin, 0.1\" pitch header. The board also has a single mounting hole if you want to screw it onto something.",

			"The EggBot Original Deluxe Edition is a friendly art robot that can draw on spherical or egg-shaped objects from the size of a ping pong ball to that of a small grapefruit-- roughly 1.25 to 4.25 inches in diameter (3 - 10 cm). It is super adjustable, and is designed to draw on all kinds of things that are normally \"impossible\" to print on. Not just eggs but ping pong balls, light bulbs, mini pumpkins, and even things like wine glasses-- with a bit of work. In the photos, you can see just a few of the things that you can make with an EggBot: Incredible personalized golf balls, christmas ornaments, light bulbs, and (yes) eggs.",
			"The EggBot chassis is made of tough fiberglass, with integrated heat sinks for the included motors. The pen and egg motors are high-torque precision stepping motors, and the pen lift mechanism is a quiet and reliable servo motor. The EggBot kit is easy to assemble in an hour or so, and only requires a couple of basic tools like miniature Phillips-head and flathead screwdrivers. You'll also need a reasonably modern computer with an available USB port (Mac, Windows or Linux), plus internet access to download assembly instructions and necessary software.",
			"The standard pen holder included with the EggBot kit is designed to fit various art pens including Sharpie Ultra-Fine Point pens. However, it can actually fit almost any pen of similar size. If you want to use a pen that doesn't fit, the pen holder is made of wood and can be enlarged to suit your taste.",

			"The LSM9DS1 9DoF ±2000°/sec ±16g IMU is one of only a handful of IC’s that can measure three key properties of movement – angular velocity, acceleration, and heading – in a single IC. By measuring these three properties, you can gain a great deal of knowledge about an object’s movement and orientation. The LSM9DS1 measures each of these movement properties in three dimensions. That means it produces nine pieces of data: acceleration in x/y/z, angular rotation in x/y/z, and magnetic force in x/y/z. The LSM9DS1 Breakout has labels indicating the accelerometer and gyroscope axis orientations, which share a right-hand rule relationship with each other.",

At 1m distance the area is approximately 3cm by 3cm. At 10m it is approximately 30cm by 30cm, increasing linearly with range.",
