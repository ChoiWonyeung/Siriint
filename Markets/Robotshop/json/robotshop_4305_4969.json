			"ROSbot is powered from an internal, rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack that contains 3 Li-Ion cells, connected in series. This type of connection is called “3S”. The schematic below explains how the cells are wired together and with the charging connector (on ROSbot side).",
			"The BAT+ and BAT- are the power connections and the “bal Bxx” wires are used to monitor the voltage on each cell. It is strongly recommended to keep equal voltages on each cell during the charging process. The charger included with ROSbot can charge batteries in the described way and, thanks to that, the long life of the battery set is possible.",
			"Please make sure that the user firmware always contains the function that monitors the supply voltage level. Deep discharging of batteries may decrease their lifecycle. Discharging to the voltage lower than 3 V / cell can also trigger the over-discharge protection. If the voltage is too low, turn ROSbot off and charge batteries as soon as possible. The ROSbot kit contains the Redox Beta charger. It is a universal charger, suitable for charging NiCd, NiMH, Li-Po, Li-Fe, Li-Ion, and Pb (AGM, VRLA) batteries. ROSbot shall be charged using an included charger and cable.",

There are no metal parts or gears, the Hand is composed exclusively of pieces made of 3D printing and fixing screws. It will be able to perform movements you've never seen in any other Robot.",
			"It is capable of carrying out every grip and position because on each part of the finger a servomotor is mounted which takes care of producing the rotation of the respective joint. The plastic material obtained with 3D Printing has allowed to design shapes of a supreme value, a compact and flexible content of technology. You can print it with the colors that best represent you so you can transform it into an artistic expression.",
			"Youbionic provides the elements to create robotics and bionics never seen up to today. Modeling generated through mathematical algorithms and the study of forms that nature offers every day has allowed us to develop unique design skills, Youbionic Hand brings a new dimension of existence.",
			"The mechanical elements have been completely redesigned, so the hand is now more resistant to the efforts during operation. The project parameters have been modified to uplift the strength it manages to do, so it's ready for most of the everyday exercise, how to lift objects, tighten handles, and then interact with the outside world as a biological hand.",
			"The mechanics are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller that can be programmed on a PC or Mac. Another unique feature of Youbionic Hand is modularity, each finger is stand-alone and has been designed to be part of alternative configurations.",

			"The SparkFun LilyPad Light Sensor is a sewable breakout board with an ALS-PT19 light sensor built in and ready to use right away. Each sensor outputs voltage between 0V and 3.3V depending on the level of ambient light shining on it. As more light is applied on the sensor, more current will flow from the board through the signal tab to the microcontroller you connect the sensor to. If the sensor receives no light, no current will flow through it. In a typical indoor lighting situation, the sensor will output around 1 to 2V. Adding this board into your next e-textile or wearable project will really open up the possibilities by being able to incorporate light level sensing capabilities.",

Combo bundle teaches robotics using Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. World’s easiest and most powerful robot software designed for EZ-Robots. Scales from beginner to advanced users. This software introduces amazing features that will teach students the skills needed to succeed in the future!",
			"JD includes apps for walking, dancing, and even playing the piano! The EZ-Builder Software includes an amazing and easy-to-use animation GAIT feature called Auto Positioner. This allows you to create movement animations for your robot to walk, dance or give high fives! The animations can be triggered by other input controls, such as Speech Recognition, Vision Tracking, Joysticks, Wii Controllers, and more.",
			"JD's eyes have 18 RGB LEDs (9 per eye), which can be configured to animate patterns with 1 million color combinations. A robot wouldn't be a robot without a camera for visual recognition. So, it installed a camera in the head which can track and learn colors, objects, faces, motion, glyphs, and more.",
			"A hexapod is a robot that has six legs, giving it more stability and freedom to move than ordinary robots. It needs only three legs to balance while standing and can walk with just four. Its other legs can reach for new foot positions, or manipulate objects! The camera features advanced vision learning, detection and tracking abilities. Your ezrobot can interact with objects, colors, faces, motion, glyphs, and QR codes!",
			"The compact grippers are powered by strong metal geared servo motors, allowing your robot to interact with soft, light objects. Recommend colored foam balls – the kind you can find at any value, hobby, or department store. They are perfect for your robot to grip and interact with. In the classroom or at home, ezrobot Revolution has a big impact on STEM education. Learn about robots, and have fun doing it! With hundreds of tutorials, no questions are left unanswered. Personalizing your ezrobot with new behaviors will teach students how robots walk, see, hear and interact with their surroundings to solve problems using a combination of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

			"When the 3.3V digital output mode of your VINT port is not enough, the Phidget VINT 4 Isolated Solid State Relay Module adds four PWM-enabled solid state relay outputs to your system. Because it uses relay outputs, you can control more powerful devices that require up to 30V and 8A. LED strips, DC motors, power relays, fans and other small circuits are just a few examples of what can be controlled with this module.",
			"Low-Side Switching\nEach solid state relay switches an external circuit to ground when enabled. This action allows completion of the circuit in order to power a load. The power to the load is supplied externally and should be connected in series with the load and the relay output. Alternatively, you could use a pull-up resistor on the input of your load and then switch the input to ground when you want it to turn off. Each channel has a ground terminal beside it to make wiring a snap, and each one leads to a common ground.",
			"PWM Switching\nIn addition to switching at microsecond speeds, each relay output is also capable of pulse-width modulation; rather than simply switching on or off, you can select a percentage duty cycle to limit the power being supplied to a specific level. This allows you to control devices like a dimmer would, which is an important feature for LEDs, fans, and motors. Check the datasheet for your device to ensure that it is designed to be used with PWM (some devices such as incandescent or CF bulbs are not designed for dimming).",

This style clamp set has long been popular on full-size milling machines, and manufacturer now produces a nice set suitable for miniature machine tools. The step blocks are notched as the back of the clamps to make it quick and easy to set your clamps to the proper height. A selection of threaded studs from 1\" to 3-1/2\" is provided to allow a variety of heights to be selected quickly. The nut and washer design is a nice touch too. The bottom of the nut is convex while the top of the washer has a matching concave surface. Even if the clamp isn't level, the washer will seat flat on top of it while applying even pressure. Also provided is a spare, unanodized step block that you can cut down to make smaller size step blocks for low setups. At least one set of hold-down clamps should be considered a necessity for every milling machine owner.",

The first member of the L series, the Actuonix L12, is an axial design with a powerful drivetrain and a rectangular cross section for increased rigidity. But by far the most attractive feature of this actuator is the broad spectrum of available configurations. For more information on configuration options, please view the L12 Configuration Sheet.",
			"Control and Position Feedback :\nThis actuator provides an analog position feedback signal that can be read by an external controller. While voltage is applied to the motor V+ and ground leads, the actuator extends. If the polarity of this voltage is reversed, the actuator retracts. Actuator stroke position may be monitored by providing any stable low and high reference voltages on leads 1 and 5, and then reading the position signal on lead 2. The voltage on lead 2 will vary linearly between the two reference voltages in proportion to the position of the actuator stroke.",

With a 7mm double-flat output shaft (avoid using the green double flat output - it's not meant to take rotational load), and a built-in clutch and built-in mounting screw holes, you can see why we like these motors! These fit perfectly with GMPW and GMW plastic wheels.\n\nGM8 - Gear Motors are compatible with the Solarbotics Wheel Watcher Rotation Encoder.

			"The Advanced Robotic Manipulator (ARM 3.0) - Closed Loop is a six-axis robotic arm with an open control interface to allow simple implementation into other projects. Each joint is commanded to position via RC PWM signals. Carbon fiber segments and CNC machined aircraft grade aluminum make the ARM 3.0 a robust unit. With a reach diameter of over 2 meters and ability to lift 4.5kg (10 pounds) it is a very capable ARM value.",
			"This 6 degree of freedom arm uses linear actuators and rotary servos to provide an operation envelope of over 7 ft in diameter. Sealed ball bearings provide precision movement at each joint. The lower 4 joints use absolute encoders for precise, linear control. Typical current draw at full capacity is approximately 7 amps. Rotation speed of base joint is 60 degrees / second. Wrist rotates 240 degrees in 2.3 seconds. Gripper moves from fully open to fully closed in less than 1 second. Reverse power protection and over-current protection is built into to the unit. A power switch with green LED \"on\" state indication is located on the electronics enclosure.",
			"Closed-Loop Position Control\nAll joints operate in a closed loop position control mode. All joints are PWM ready if you choose to command from your microcontroller or from an RC radio. All joints utilize absolute feedback. This version of the ARM is best suited for applications where the ARM will be under computer control and where the computer will send a PWM command to the each joint of the ARM to go to a specific position. The ARM will then hold that position.",
			"Improvements Over Arm 2.0\nThe ARM 3.0 leverages the success of the ARM 1.0 and 2.0 projects. It supersedes ARM 2.0 and provides improved performance. Better reliability and more lifting capacity are notable improvements as well as better optimized ranges of travel for each joint. Absolute encoder feedback at the joints improves control and position feedback resolution and linearity.",

			"The Pololu USB AVR Programmer is an extremely compact, low-cost in-system programmer (ISP) for Atmel's AVR microcontrollers, which makes this device an attractive programming solution for AVR-based controllers like Pololu Orangutan robot controllers. The USB AVR programmer connects to your computer's USB port via an included USB A to mini-B cable and communicates with your programming software, such as AVR Studio or AVRDUDE, through a virtual COM port using the AVRISPV2/STK500 protocol. The programmer connects to your target device via an included 6-pin ISP programming cable (the older, 10-pin ISP connections are not directly supported, but it's easy to create or purchase a 6-pin-to-10-pin ISP adapter).",
			"This device is a programmer for AVR-based controllers, such as our Orangutan robot controllers and the 3pi robot. The programmer emulates an AVRISP v2 on a virtual serial port, making it compatible with standard AVR programming software. Two additional features help with building and debugging projects: a TTL-level serial port for general-purpose communication and a SLO-scope for monitoring signals and voltage levels (please see the useful links tab).",
			"Supported Microcontrollers",
			"The programmer should work with all AVRs that can be programmed by an AVR ISP, but it has not been tested on all devices (it has been tested with all Orangutan robot controllers and the 3pi Robot). The programmer features upgradable firmware, allowing updates for future devices. It does not currently work with Atmel's XMega line of microcontrollers. The programmer is powered by the 5V USB power bus, and it is intended for programming AVRs that are running at close to 5V (note that the programmer does not deliver power to the target device).",
			"Supported Operating Systems",
			"The programmer has been tested under Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Linux. It is not compatible with any version of Mac OS or with older versions of Windows.",
			"Note: This programmer supports standard in-system programming (ISP), which is also sometimes called in-circuit serial programming (ICSP). It does not support JTAG, DebugWire, or High-Voltage programming, and it does not support the Mac OS at this time.",

The gearbox is very sturdy outside and in, with larger-pitch gears than found in cheap gearboxes of a similar size, allowing it to transfer and support higher torque loads without the gear teeth breaking. A 8mm diameter output shaft with dual ball-bearing support means that relatively large loads can be mounted directly to the output shaft.",

The right-angle gearbox also enables the motor to fit into positions that planetary and conventional spur gear motors wouldn't be able to.",
			"Special effects, DIY, robotics and automation projects can all benefit from the steady output speed and the resistance to being rotated (self-locking property) which is provided by the worm-and-wheel stage once the motor is in a position.

The Qwiic OpenLog can store, or \"log\", huge amounts of serial data and act as a black box of sorts to store all the data that your project generates, for scientific or debugging purposes. Utilizing the handy Qwiic system, no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still have broken out 0.1\"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.",
			"Like its predecessor, the SparkFun Qwiic OpenLog runs off of an onboard ATmega328, running at 16MHz thanks to the onboard resonator. The ATmega328 has been sure to feature the Optiboot bootloader loaded, which allows the OpenLog to be compatible with the “Arduino Uno” board setting in the Arduino IDE. It is important to be aware that the Qwiic OpenLog draws approximately 2 mA - 6 mA in idle (nothing to record) mode, however, during a full record, the OpenLog can draw 20 mA to 23 mA depending on the microSD card being used.",
			"The Qwiic OpenLog also supports clock stretching, which means it performs even better than the original and will record data up to 20,000 bytes per second at 400 kHz. As the receive buffer fills up this OpenLog will hold the clock line, letting the master know that it is busy. Once the Qwiic OpenLog is finished with a task, it releases the clock thus allowing the data to continue flowing without corruption.",

			"Its small size (only 1.65” x 1.3” x 0.585”) makes it a perfect candidate for small platform CNC machines, 3D printers or any small to medium power automation application. At a native ten microstep resolution the G251X does not require extremely high input frequencies to operate at high speed but offers enough resolution to match the accuracy of most stepper motors (+/- 5% of one full step).",
			"An adjustable low-speed smoothness trimpot compensates for motor nonlinearity at the low end while midband resonance compensation ensures reliable torque output through the midband dropout region. Full Step Morphing is entirely unique to Geckodrive products and can transition your motor to a true full step motor between 4 – 6 revolutions per second.",

			"The Nexys4 Artix-7 FPGA Board is a ready-to-use digital circuit development platform designed to bring additional industry applications into the classroom environment. With its large, high-capacity FPGA  and collection of USB, Ethernet, and other ports, the Nexys 4 DDR can host designs ranging from introductory combinational circuits to powerful embedded processors. Several built-in peripherals, including an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, MEMs digital microphone, speaker amplifier and plenty of I/O devices allow the Nexys 4 DDR to be used for a wide range of designs without needing any other components. The most notable improvement is the replacement of the 16 MiB CellularRAM with a 128 MiB DDR2 SDRAM memory. Digilent will provide a VHDL reference module that wraps the complexity of a DDR2 controller and is backwards compatible with the asynchronous SRAM interface of the CellularRAM, with certain limitations. \n\nThe Artix-7 FPGA is optimized for high performance logic, and offers more capacity, higher performance, and more resources than earlier designs.

Solar Cockroach is a simple solar activity designed to teach kids about solar energy, motion, and engineering. Sunlight directly powers a vibrating motor attached to the underside of the Solar Cockroach, no batteries required.",
			"The Solar Cockroach is intended for makers ages 10 and up. There are two different ways to build the Cockroach; either use the included Maker Tape to connect the vibrating motor to the solar cell or use a soldering iron to quickly solder the motor to the solar cell.",
			"To complete this project you will need a hot glue gun and a wire cutter. The project takes 10-20 minutes to complete and will never run out of power since the sun is its power source. Use this kit as a stand-alone activity or as part of a larger solar lesson.",
			"WARNING: Some modern windows are coated with an anti UV layer which will oftentimes prevent the Solar Cockroach from powering the motor. When in doubt have your student go outside in pure direct sunlight.",

			"The RoboteQ magnetic track sensor is a sensor capable of detecting and reporting the position of a magnetic field along its horizontal axis. The sensor is intended for line following robotic applications, using a magnetic tape to form a track guide on the floor. The sensor uses advanced signal processing to accurately measure its lateral distance from the center of the track, with millimeter resolution, resulting in nearly 160 points end to end.",
			"Tape position information can be output in numerical format on the sensor's RS232 or USB ports. The position is also reported as a 0 to 3 V voltage output and as a variable PWM output. Additionally, the sensor supports a dedicated MultiPWM mode allowing seamless communication with all Roboteq motor controllers using only one wire.",
			"The sensor will detect and manage up to 2-way forks and can be instructed to follow the left or right track using commands issued via the serial/USB ports, or using the state of two digital inputs. All of the sensor's operating parameters and commands are also accessible via its CAN bus interface.",
			"In addition to detecting a track to follow, the sensor will detect and report the presence of magnetic markers that may be positioned on the left or right side of the track. The sensor is equipped with four LEDs for easy monitoring and diagnostics. The MGS1600GY includes a 3-axis Gyroscope that can be used to provide additional stability and guidance to the vehicle.",
			"The sensor incorporates a high performance, Basic-like scripting language that allows users to add customized functionality to the sensor. A PC utility is provided for configuring the sensor, capture and plot the sensor data on a strip chart recorder, and visualize in real time the magnetic field as it is seen by the sensor.",

			"The Super-Beacon has a separate receiving part with a single wide-beam microphone and sharp DSP filters (like Mini-RX or Industrial-RX has). Thus, it is more sensitive, than Beacon HW v4.9, more resistant to external noise, and easier to set up, because you don’t have to care about turning on and off ultrasonic sensors in order to optimize coverage vs. sensitivity.",
			"The Super-Beacon can receive any ultrasonic frequency from the bands: 19 kHz, 25 kHz, 31 kHz, 37 kHz, 45 kHz. The filter can be simply selected in the Dashboard. At the same time, the ultrasonic frequency of Beacon HW v4.9 is HW-defined by ultrasonic sensors and can’t be changed.",

			"The Arduino MKR WAN 1310 Microcontroller (w/o Antenna) board provides a practical and cost-effective solution to add LoRa connectivity to projects requiring low power.",
			"This open-source board can be connected to the Arduino IoT Cloud, your own LoRa network using the Arduino LoRa PRO Gateway, existing LoRaWAN infrastructure like The Things Network, or even other boards using the direct connectivity mode.",
			"The MKR WAN 1310, brings in a series of improvements when compared to its predecessor, the MKR WAN 1300. While still based on the Microchip SAMD21 low power processor, the Murata CMWX1ZZABZ LoRa module, and the MKR family’s characteristic crypto chip (the ECC508), the MKR WAN 1310 includes a new battery charger, a 2MByte SPI Flash, and improved control of the board’s power consumption.",
			"The latest modifications have considerably improved the battery life on the MKR WAN 1310. When properly configured, the power consumption is now as low as 104uA! It is also possible to use the USB port to supply power (5 V) to the board; run the board with or without batteries - the choice is yours.",
			"Data logging and other OTA (Over The Air) functions are now possible since the inclusion of the onboard 2MByte Flash. This new exciting feature will let you transfer configuration files from the infrastructure onto the board, create your own scripting commands, or simply store data locally to send it whenever the connectivity is best.",

			"The Pololu IR Beacon Transceivers are devices meant to be used in pairs to give robots a simple mean for detecting each other. You can use the beacons to build pairs of robots that interact or chase one another or to make a robot that can identify and return to a home base. For example, you could build a \"cat robot\" and \"mouse robot\" that each have an IR beacon, where the cat chases the mouse and the mouse runs away from the cat. These beacons are ideal for autonomous robot contests in which robots compete in pairs.",
			"The new IR beacons feature round PCBs with six wide-angle emitters to provide uniform broadcasting in all directions. The on-board voltage monitoring enables more consistent output brightness over the voltage range. Most components are pre-assembled, so all you need to solder is the capacitor, connectors, and IR sensors (make sure you solder them in from the bottom of the PCB!).\n\nNote: The Pololu IR beacon is a kit; before using it, you need to assemble the beacon by soldering its components onto its circuit board. To use the kit in robotics projects, you need to connect it to your own robot controller. Please note that the IR beacons only work in pairs and that certain kinds of artificial lighting (e.g. some fluorescent lights) can interfere with the sensors.\n\nHow the IR Beacons Work?\n(The following animations show the old IR beacon, but the operating principle is the same in the new, round units).\n\nThe beacons work by transmitting and detecting infrared light, much like a television remote control. Each beacon has six IR emitters and four IR detectors. The beacons alternate between transmitting and receiving so that they never get confused by reflections of their own transmissions.",
			"The transmission and detection cycle is carried out more than one thousand times per second, and a small microcontroller monitors all four detectors to decide the direction to the other beacon. The beacons have four red LEDs that indicate the direction to the other beacon; if you take two beacons and rotate them, the LEDs will always keep lighting up in the direction of the other beacon.",
			"Interfacing to the Pololu IR Beacon is simple - it has four digital outputs that indicate which of its four sides detects the other beacon the strongest. An enable input lets you select between active mode and a low-power mode.\n\nIR Beacon Development Kit (Transmit-Only Beacon)\nDue to customer requests, the IR beacon is also available as just an assembled PCB with no IR sensors or firmware. This item is intended for advanced users who want to customize their IR beacon functionality by writing their own firmware. The main processor is a Microchip PIC16F630, and the PCB includes a footprint for a 5-pin header compatible with the PIC kit 2 programmer. Also available as a single Pololu IR Beacon Transceiver (pair) (RB-Pol-29)",

The kit includes a full version of FlowBotics Studio and includes the SSC-32 as well as a serial to Bluetooth board and Bluetooth module which allows for remote control from the computer. This approach offloads the higher level calculations to the computer. FlowBotics Studio includes a demo project for the MH2 with pre-written walking algorithms. The hexapod robot is designed around a simple mechanical leg design with all metal brackets. This leg design minimizes the number of parts required to make a two DOF (degree of freedom) leg and allows this robot to be steered like a tank. Forward, reverse and in place turning is supported. The robot uses standard sized Hitec servos for the legs. The combo kit includes everything you need to make a functional robot except batteries and optional PS2 controller.\n\nThe Mechanics\nThe body of the hexapod is made from ultra-tough laser-cut PVC structural components while the legs are made from high-quality aluminum Servo Erector Set brackets. The kit includes 12 servos; six HS-422 and six 645MG. The hexapod is able to adjust its height, walk forward and in reverse, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise, tit forward and backward, left and right and more.",

The Tsunami also supports true seamless looping over an arbitrary track length.",
			"The big news is that the Tsunami has 8 audio output channels, arranged as either 8 mono or 4 stereo pairs. Alternate versions of firmware support either mono or stereo architecture – you choose. The mono version adds a new “Synced Set” trigger function that can start up to 8 mono tracks on adjacent outputs. These tracks will start and stay in sample-sync for playing stereo or even 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound content with a single trigger. Any track can be dynamically routed to any output. And each output provides independent real-time volume and sample-rate conversion (pitch bend.)",

			"Wings",
			"Fuselage\nThe trapezoidal shape of the fuselage minimizes the fuselage to wing interaction, drag and interference. It was designed with a high pressure region in the nose and a low pressure region behind the wing, on top and below the motor mounting area. This acts to create a pressure differential, essentially \"pulling\" air through the fuselage. The layout allows for smarter cooling, by cooling off lower temperature components towards the front, and higher temperature components in the rear (motor). The cooling exhaust placement was purposely in an area with turbulent airflow, so as to not disturb the otherwise laminar airflow over the rest of the fuselage.",
			"Tail",
			"Versatility\nYou can use the Albatross for search and rescue missions, inspections of pipelines, photography, filmmaking, thermal imaging, 3D terrain mapping, precision agriculture, surveillance, reconnaissance, FPV, live video links, humanitarian aid, fun and much, much more.",
			"Capability\nThe Albatross is nearly silent, can fly for over 2 hrs, reach speeds of up to 90 MPH and travel for over 100 miles. The modified Albatross kits allow you to fly autonomously, capture stunning HD photos and video, complete aerial surveys, monitor crop health, and wirelessly transmit live video. This is all done with incredible accuracy thanks to an onboard lidar system.",
			"Scorpion Systems Motor\nMotor offers unbelievable power and reliability. Albatross kits & RTF models come with a Castle Creations electronic speed controller (esc). More specifically, the Edge 100, with its 100-amperage continuous draw ability and logging capability. Included is the Castle Creations built (Battery Eliminator Circuit) BEC pro which can provide up to 20 amps output to power necessary onboard systems.",
			"Hitec is among the most reliable servo manufacturers around today. APC Propellers are widely available and easily changeable. PX4 PIXHAWK is the brain of the aircraft for computer controlled flight and autonomous operation. This system is on the cutting edge of autonomous flight control & stabilization",

			"Omni-directional wheels are unique as they are able to roll freely in two directions. It can either roll like a normal wheel or roll laterally using the wheels along its circumference. Omni-direction wheels allow a robot to convert from a non-holonomic to a holonomic robot. A non-holonomic robot that uses normal wheels has only 2 out of 3 controllable degrees of freedom which are, moving forward/backwards and rotation. Not being able to move side ways makes a robot slower and less efficient in reaching its given goal. The holonomic omni-directional wheels are able to overcome this problem, as it is a highly maneuverable. Unlike normal non-holonomic robot, the holonomic omni-directional robot can move in an arbitrary direction continuously without changing the direction of the wheels. It can move back and forth, sideways and rotates at the same position.\n\nFeatures:",

			"The Dimension Engineering Buffered ±3g Tripple Axis Accelerometer is the most advanced analog accelerometer solution to date, featuring a triple axis ±3g accelerometer chip. It also has integrated op amp buffers for direct connection to a microcontroller's analog inputs, or for driving heavier loads.\n\nThe ACCM-3D has an onboard 3.3V LDO regulator, allowing you to power the board with 3.5V to 15V sources. You can also use this regulator to power an external microcontroller with up to 50mA. For operation as low as 2.0V, you can bypass the voltage regulator and choose your own operating voltage.\n\nIt is designed to fit in the DIP-16 form factor, making the DE-ACCM3D suitable for breadboarding, perfboarding, and insertion into standard chip sockets. To keep things as simple as possible, there are only 5 pins - two for power, and three for the X, Y and Z analog outputs. Additional circuitry ensures that the product won't be damaged by reversed power connections.",

			"The Seeedstudio DS3231 High Precision RTC Clock Module for Raspberry Pi is based on the clock chip DS3231, the DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C real-time clock (RTC). It can provide a real-time clock(RTC) for raspberry pi via the I2C interface.",
			"With the clock source from the TCXO (temperature compensated crystal oscillator), the RTC provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date at the end of the month is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.",
