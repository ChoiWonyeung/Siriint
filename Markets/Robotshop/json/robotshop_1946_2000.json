			"The Parallax Propeller 40-Pin DIP Chip - P8X32A-D40 is Parallax's own all-custom silicon, designed at the transistor level by schematic. The Propeller module is a multi-processing chip, with shared memory and a built-in interpreter for programming in a high-level object-oriented language, called SpinT, and low-level (assembly) language. With the set of pre-built Parallax 'objects' for video, mouse, keyboards, NTSC/VGA displays, LCDs, stepper motors and sensors your application is a matter of high-level integration with Propeller chips. The Propeller chips are designed for high-speed embedded processing, while maintaining low power, low current consumption and a small physical footprint.",
			"The P8X32A-D40 is most useful for prototyping in its 40-pin DIP package. Connect the Propeller module to your computer's serial or USB port using the Prop Plug for programming is quite simple. The Propeller chip can run on its own with a power supply, internal clock and using RAM for code storage. Add an external EEPROM for non-volatile code storage.",

			"The Pololu QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor Array has 8 IR LED/phototransistor pairs mounted on a 0.375\" pitch, making it a great detector for a line-following robot. Pairs of LEDs are arranged in series to halve current consumption, and a MOSFET allows the LEDs to be turned off for additional sensing or power-savings options. Each sensor provides a separate analog voltage output.",
			"The QTR-8A reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VIN (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection.",
			"The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control.",
			"The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20-25 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA.",
			"Breaking the Module in Two:\nIf you don't need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown above. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor.",

A non-holonomic robot that uses normal wheels has only 2 out of 3 controllable degrees-of-freedom - moving forward/backwards and rotation. Not being able to move side ways makes a robot slower and less efficient in reaching its given goal.",
