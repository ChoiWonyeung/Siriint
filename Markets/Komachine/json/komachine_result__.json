YuMi was a game-changer and heralded a new era where people and robots safely and productively work side-by-side, without barriers.                 Collaborative robots are adept at adding flexibility to assembly processes that need to make small lots of highly individualized products, in short cycles. By combining people’s unique ability to adapt to change with robot’s tireless endurance for precise, repetitive tasks, it is possible to automate the assembly of many types of products on the same line.                About YuMi®Human - robot collaborationInnovative human - friendly dual arm robot with breakthrough functionality designed to unlock vast global additional automation potential in industry. YuMi® is designed for a new era of automation, for example in small parts assembly, where people and robots work side-by-side on the same tasks. Safety is built into the functionality of the robot itself. YuMi® removes the barriers to collaboration by making fencing and cages a thing of the past.ABB’s growing family of YuMi robots is part of a suite of exciting collaborative automation solutions that help people and robots safely work closer together than every before possible.ABB is adding a new member to the YuMi family, 7 axis YuMi, the smallest and most agile collaborative robot yet, making it easier than ever to put into production. The new 7 axis also opens up a world of flexible possibilities – for example a single-arm and a dual-arm YuMi could be combined to add a parts feed or inspection station to an assembly cell. Additionally, customer might want to have three or five YuMi arms in an application to improve the cycle time.

The ultra-light magnesium arm rotates on seven axes to mimic human-like movements with greater agility than 6-axis robots. The robot was specifically designed to meet the flexible production needs required by small parts assembly processes including consumer electronics, consumer goods, and small and medium enterprises.                Easy-to-use lead-through programmingSingle-arm YuMi also features the same intuitive, easy-to-use lead through programming as dual-arm YuMi collaborative robot, meaning workers can teach the robot motions and positions easily and quickly, greatly simplifying robot programming. Combining this simplicity with the robot’s deployment flexibility, it will help manufacturers in many industries to offset shortages of skilled workers and help reduce entry barriers for new potential robot users, particularly small and medium enterprises.                Extremely versatile, the YuMi family of robots can be combined in numerous configurations. For example, a single-arm YuMi can be used to feed parts to dual-arm YuMi to increase flexibility, or added as an extra arm for more complex assembly tasks requiring more than 2 robot arms.The robot powered by OmniCore controller is now available for order.                Key features- 500g rated payload- Small footprint, 7-axis dexterity- Very lightweight manipulator, 9.5 kg- Mounting in any position- Integrated gripper with vision and vacuum- Best-in-class safety design- High speed and accuracy- PL d Cat 3 Protective stop and emergency stopCustomer benefits- Short cycle times- Fenceless operation- Easy programming with lead-through- Lower investment- Easier to integrate",

Class-leading performance for high-quality manufacturingAimed at increasing manufacturing productivity, IRB 1100 provides up to 35% faster cycle times and best-in-class repeatability for high quality manufacturing.                IRB 1100 consistently outperforms similar robots in terms of payload and position repeatability (RP) even when under space constraints. Indeed, IRB 1100 offers the highest payload for a robot of its class.                Compact and small footprint design ensures flexible installation Compared to the previous generation, the IRB 1100 robot design was optimized with a 10% smaller footprint and over 20% weight reduction for spaceefficient installation in diverse environments, such as electronics manufacturing factories.

			"0": "A compact, flexible, fast and functional small industrial robotHave you ever wanted to make your machines 15% smaller and 10% faster? ABB’s IRB 1200 allows you to do exactly that. Specifically, it addresses the needs of the Material Handling and Machine Tending industries for flexibility, ease-of-use, compactness and short cycle times while still maintaining large working envelopes.                As a family of robots, the IRB 1200 comes in two variants which can handle a wide range of applications. Both IRB 1200 variants can be mounted at any angle and come with IP 40 protection as standard. Both variants are available with Food Grade Lubrication, SafeMove2, Foundry Plus 2 and Clean Room option. The 700 mm reach variant can carry a payload of up to 7 kg, while the longer reach 900 mm variant can carry up to 5 kg of payload.                SafeMove2The IRB 1200 SafeMove2 becomes the smallest ABB robot to feature the advanced safety-certified monitoring and control software solution which allows robots and operators to work more closely together by restricting robot motion to precisely what is needed for a specific application.                CompactThe IRB 1200 has no offset in axis two, which results in a longer stroke than other small robots and it, meaning it can be placed very close to the work piece and still be functional. This allows for a much more compact installation when the robot is mounted on the ceiling inside a small cell, such as in electronics machining or polishing applications. The robots’ large useable working area contained in a small package leads to shorter cycles and more compact machines.                Food Grade Lubrication and Clean Room optionThis Food Grade Lubrication (NSF H1) option includes Clean Room ISO class 3 and IP67 protection rating which ensure uncompromising safety and hygiene for food and beverage applications. The Clean Room ISO class 3 design eliminates the potential for contamination of the food handling area. This option provides smooth surfaces and makes it easy to keep clean and maintain in environments such as CNC machine tending and material handling in the food industry. This results in features that allow for 15% smaller cells with 10% shorter cycle times.                Foundry Plus 2The IRB 1200 is also available with Foundry Plus 2, ABB’s optional protection system which allows it to withstand harsh environments for example heavy duty metal casting and automotive applications.                Features and benefits- 15% smaller cells that have 10% shorter cycle times- Available with Food Grade Lubrication- Optionally with SafeMove2 functionality -Available with Foundry Plus 2 protection for harsh environments- IP40 protection as standard; Clean Room, IP67 and Foundry Plus 2 protection are also available options- 4 air ducts, 10 customer signals and Ethernet routed internally from wrist flange to foot- Mountable at any angle- Large usable working area in a compact footprint",

			"0": "The highest performance 10kg robot.Performance is often a trade off, optimizing for speed or accuracy. With ABB’s IRB 1600, you don’t have to choose. The robot’s cycle times are shorter, sometimes half that of other robots, allowing you to increase throughput. Meanwhile, you will enjoy the work piece quality that only an ABB robot can offer. Extra everything.                Double your throughputThe IRB 1600 has up to 50 percent shorter cycle times than competing robots in material handling, machine tending and process applications. It speeds up and slows down faster than other robots, saving time while moving between tasks. This is possible due to ABB’s patented second generation QuickMove motion control, combined with the robot’s strong motors and low friction losses in the spur gears.                No more cutting cornersAt high speed, most robots will cut corners. With the IRB 1600, the path will be the same regardless of speed, thanks to the robot’s unique combination of brains and brawn. Intelligent second generation True Move motion control means that ”what-you program-is-what-you-get”. Add muscle – a heavy and stiff design – low vibrations and low friction – and you have a robot that will deliver consistently high work piece quality, high yield and few rejects.                Outstanding reliabilityThe IRB 1600 offers outstanding reliability, even in the toughest environments and the most demanding 24/7 duty cycles. The entire manipulator is IP 54 classed and sensitive parts are IP 67 classed as standard.                The optional protection Foundry Plus offers IP 67, special paint, rust protection and is tailor made for tough foundry environments. The rigid and heavy design combined with spur gears, make the robot extremely robust. Smart collision detection software further adds to the robot’s outstanding reliability.                Easy to integrateMounting is fully flexible: on a shelf, on the wall, tilted or inverted. By choosing the compact short arm version with the 1.2 m reach, you can even fit the IRB 1600 inside a machine, while ensuring sufficient payload as the maximum total load is as high as 36 kg. Sustainable and healthy Low friction spur gears, and no unnecessary moves due to Quick Move and True Move, reduces power consumption down to 0.58 kW at max speed, and even less at low speeds. The airborne noise level of just <70 dB (A) secures a healthy sound environment.

Up to 10% shorter cycle timesIRB 1660ID’s new compact wrist with very powerful motors enables fast and reliable movements that do not impede swinging cables and allow maximum acceleration and speed at all times. This combined with ABB’s Quick Move TM technology allows the IRB 1660ID to shorten cycle times up to 10% compared to competition.                Outstanding weld qualityThe demand for superior and quality in arc welding applications has                increased, requiring improved wire feeding control near the arc to guarantee high volume production. The IRB 1660ID has a stronger more rigid upper arm able to lift up to 6 kg to accommodate heavier torches.                This, combined with ABB‘s True Move TM technology and the new motion process “Accuracy mode” provides 0.05 mm path repeatability for excellent welding results.                Safe robot movements enable high density cellsThe IRB 1660ID with the aid of Robot Studio®, ABB’s premier offline robot software programming tool, enables robot programmers to envision high density cells with several robots welding close to each other with a minimum of work piece heat distortions.                Robot Studio simulations help to secure safe robot movements with max speed and accelerations at all times to provide predictable and shortest possible and cycle times. Such high density cells can maximize your output, provide top quality parts and operate with unmatched reliability.                Fast, agile and reliable for machine tendingThe compact and hollow wrist enables fast and reliable movements since the robot can move at maximum acceleration and speed without damaging the Integrated Dress Pack. The risk of collision in confined spaces is also eliminated. The combined working range of axes 4, 5 and 6 of 1,390° provides outstanding agility inside CNC machines. The IP67 wrist, the protection of the callings from water and the controlled movements provide up to 50 percent lower maintenance costs and a longer life expectancy.                Simplified online programmingOnline programming is further simplified thanks to the full control of the hose packages or callings, the compact 135 mm size wrist for faster re-orientations and the 0.30 mm TCP reorientation accuracy (absolute accuracy option needed) for highly accurate corner re-orientations.                 Main applications- Arc welding- Machine tending- Material handling                Movie : Introducing IRB 1660ID",

			"0": "ABB further extends its mid range robot familyThe IRB 2600 is the second model in the sharp generation range with enhanced and new capabilities. It is a compact robot with a high payload capacity. The design has been optimized for targeted applications like arc welding, material handling and machine tending. The IRB 2600 is available in three variants, with options for floor, wall, shelf, tilted or inverted mounting configurations.                Sharp accuracyWith the best accuracy in its class, the IRB 2600 can help you increase output with higher process speeds and lower scrap rates, resulting in improved productivity. This is particularly useful in process applications, such as arc welding. The high accuracy is achieved by use of the patented True Move™ motion control software.                Short cycle timesThanks to the compact and optimized design resulting in a low weight, the IRB 2600 can cut the cycle times of the industry benchmark by up to 25 %. The patented Quick Move™ motion control software ensures that the maximum acceleration achievable is highest in its class, together with high maximum speeds. The benefit is increased production capacity and high productivity.                Large working rangeThe combination of large working range and flexible mounting makes it possible to reach machines to be served without interfering with auxiliary equipment. By optimizing the robot placement, you’ll benefit from higher productivity. Flexible mounting is also very useful when you are simulating the best position for your application.                Compact designThe IRB 2600 has the same small foot print as IRB 4600. With the IRB 2600 you can create your production cell with reduced floor space by placing the robot closer to the served machines. The robots’ design makes it easier for the lower arm to reach straight downwards.

			"0": "Industrial robotFeaturing a unique combination of high payload capacity, large working range, and Integrated Dressing (ID), which routes all cables and hoses inside the robot’s upper arm and wrist. These robots can reduce cycle times by up to 15%, significantly increasing production output in a variety of applications.                Shorter cycle timesBecause all process cables and hoses are routed inside the robot arm, the IRB 2600ID robots dramatically decrease downtime caused by interference and wear. This integration also ensures that the maximum achievable acceleration is available at all times without restriction. These features help to significantly reduce total cycle times and increase reliability.                There are two models in the range. The 2 m reach, 8 kg version is designed to be integrated with arc welding process equipment. The 1.85 m reach, 15 kg model comes with a flexible conduit designed to optimize material handling and machine tending.                Faster programmingThe ease with which off-line programs can be created with Integrated Dressing (ID). The controlled movements of the hoses and cables are easily predicted which minimizes the time required for fine-tuning programs and enables a faster start of production. Total programming time is reduced by up to 90%.                Reduced cost of ownershipWith all hoses and cables firmly secured and protected, they swing less during operation, and with less exposure to weld spatter or cutting fluids and the lifetime increases significantly. Costs are reduced in terms of purchasing and welding torch exchange by up to 75% and up to three production stops per year can be eliminated.                Higher output from a smaller footprintWith its compact design and without loose hoses and cables, the IRB 2600ID has a very small footprint with a swing base radius of only 337 mm and a base width of only 511 mm. In material handling and machine tending, this means that the robot can be placed closer to the machines being served. In arc welding the reduced risk of interference with other robots allows for productive, high-density installations with 50% more robots, and up to 50% higher output from a production cell. That’s how the IRB 2600ID helps you make the most out of your production space; higher output from a smaller area.                Increased agility in smaller spacesThe wrist is very slim, only 227 x 130 mm. With all hoses and cables integrated through the process wrist the robot can easily access narrow openings and perform complex movements. For example, in arc welding this means that the IRB 2600ID can do circular welds without interruption and without compromising quality – and in a much shorter cycle time thereby increasing production output.

Increased agility in smaller spacesThe wrist is very slim, only 227 x 130 mm. With all hoses and cables integrated through the process wrist the robot can easily access narrow openings and perform complex movements. For example, in arc welding this means that the IRB 2600ID can do circular welds without interruption and without compromising quality – and in a much shorter cycle time thereby increasing production output.

That’s how the IRB 2600ID helps you make the most out of your production space; higher output from a smaller area.                Increased agility in smaller spacesThe wrist is very slim, only 227 x 130 mm. With all hoses and cables integrated through the process wrist the robot can easily access narrow openings and perform complex movements. For example, in arc welding this means that the IRB 2600ID can do circular welds without interruption and without compromising quality – and in a much shorter cycle time thereby increasing production output.

			"0": "New Design. New Features. New Technologies.IRB 4600 is a highly productive general purpose robot optimized for short cycle times where compact robots can help create high density cells. The IRB 4600 enables more compact manufacturing cells with increased production output and higher quality - and that means improved productivity                Shortest cycle timesThanks to the new compact and optimized design resulting in a low weight, the IRB 4600 can cut the cycle times of the industry benchmark by up to 25%. The maximum acceleration achievable is highest in its class, together with high maximum speeds. With the high acceleration it is possible to use to avoid obstacles or to follow the path. The benefit is increased production capacity and higher productivity.                Ultra-wide working rangeYou can position the IRB 4600 in the most favourable way with regard to reach, cycle time and auxiliary equipment. Flexible mounting with floor, tilted, semishelf or inverted mounting is very useful when you are simulating the best position for your application.                CompactnessThe small footprint, the slim swing base radius around axis 1, the fine elbow behind axis 3, the small lower and upper arms, and the compact wrist all contribute to the most compact robot in its class. With the IRB 4600 you can create your production cell with reduced floorspace by placing the robot closer to the served machines, which also increases your output and your productivity.                Best protection availableABB has the most comprehensive protection program on the market and it will be even further enhanced with the IRB 4600. Foundry Plus includes IP 67, resistant paint, rust protected mounting flange and protection for molten metal spits on non-moving cables on the rear of the robot and extra protection plates over the floor cable connections on the foot.                Optimize and go sharpTo get the IRB 4600 ready for the targeted applications you have access to high performing Work piece Positioned, Track Motions, and the Motor and Gear Unit range.                To simulate your production cell to find the optimal position for the robot and program it offline, Robot Studio is available on subscription together with PowerPacs for several applications.

			"0": "Industrial RobotThe IRB 6650S is the shelf robot form of the Power Robot family which offers a unique working envelope. It is capable of a full vertical and horizontal stroke motion, as well as an increased forward and downward reach. This combination offers new possibilities to robot functions in numerous application areas.                Main applications- Machine tending- Material handling- Spot welding- Die Casting                IRB 6650S is reliable with a high production up time, fast with short cycle times and strong with maximized utilization. Its main applications are machine tending, material handling, spot welding and die casting.                Material HandlingOwing to its longer reach forward and down, when put on an elevated track                it can supervise twice as many inlet conveyors with different part sizes as a traditional ceiling mounted or wall mounted track with a 5- or 6-axes robot. When compared with an inverted track and a 5 axes robot, the length of the track for the IRB 6650S can be kept much shorter and thereby simplifying installation and reducing total costs.                Injection MouldingThe IRB 6650S is especially suited for large injection moulding machines over 1,000 tons. The flexibility of the six axis robot facilitates post process applications like flaming and assembly operations.                Die CastingThe unique working envelope ensures easy access for die spraying as well as part handling. The process cabling is protected within the robot arm system, thus improving the lifetime of the process cabling.                SpotWeldingThe IRB 6650S offers the possibility to improve robot density in framing stations; the key is to place the robots at different levels. The standard IRB 6700 robot can be mounted at floor level and the IRB 6650S be placed at about 1.5-2m above floor level. By this the standard robots perform spot welding operations at the lower part of the car body and the IRB 6650S of the upper part of the car body. Thus making efficient use of space in the framing cell.                Press TendingThe IRB 6650S can handle extremely large sheets, such as complete car body sides. The working area of the robot makes it possible to retract the robot from the press even with large grippers and parts. High acceleration power is combined with a unique stroke horizontally as well as vertically. This unique combination will shorten cycle times considerably and thereby increase production capacity. The working area below the robot offers an excellent opportunity for fast tool changing of grippers.                LeanID Dress PackThe IRB 6650S is available with LeanID Dress Pack, an option that improves the possibility with many complex wrist movements and where the need for flexibility in changing products is high.",

Die CastingThe unique working envelope ensures easy access for die spraying as well as part handling. The process cabling is protected within the robot arm system, thus improving the lifetime of the process cabling.                SpotWeldingThe IRB 6650S offers the possibility to improve robot density in framing stations; the key is to place the robots at different levels. The standard IRB 6700 robot can be mounted at floor level and the IRB 6650S be placed at about 1.5-2m above floor level. By this the standard robots perform spot welding operations at the lower part of the car body and the IRB 6650S of the upper part of the car body. Thus making efficient use of space in the framing cell.                Press TendingThe IRB 6650S can handle extremely large sheets, such as complete car body sides. The working area of the robot makes it possible to retract the robot from the press even with large grippers and parts. High acceleration power is combined with a unique stroke horizontally as well as vertically. This unique combination will shorten cycle times considerably and thereby increase production capacity. The working area below the robot offers an excellent opportunity for fast tool changing of grippers.                LeanID Dress PackThe IRB 6650S is available with LeanID Dress Pack, an option that improves the possibility with many complex wrist movements and where the need for flexibility in changing products is high.",

			"0": "Fast and flexible transfer solution for medium size partsThe IRB 6660FX raises the bar in Press Automation to provide customers with more flexibility at greater speeds while saving precious press-shop floor space.                Linear part transferBy integrating a dual action unit into the IRB 6660, ABB creates the IRB 6660FX, a 7-axis robot for the transfer of medium size parts rapidly along a linear path. As a result, vibrations created when parts are rotated 180° by the conventional 6-axis robot are eliminated.                In the case of new press lines, inter-press distance can be reduced as parts are transferred without having to be rotated.                Dynamic model controlThe IRB 6660FX is also equipped with integrated dynamic model control to ensure the that all seven axes are coordinated and operating at optimum speed and lifetime.                User-friendly programming interfaceThe IRB 6660FX is programmed the same way as its 6-axis counterpart is. Additionally, it can be programmed using ABB’s StampWare.                Stamp WareCurrently running in more than 1,000 units worldwide, Stamp Ware is a family of controller software designed to make you more productive by minimizing the learning time and setup time of new production. The modularized program structure, the program wizard and the graphical production window decrease the time for training that the operator and robot programmer need. As a result, production is more efficient during installation, production set-up and optimizing of the robot cycle.                Optimized performance with carbon fiber toolingThe IRB 6660 FX’s carbon fiber tooling increases output thanks to its specially designed shape which has been optimized for tool height.

			"0": "The 7th generation of large industrial robotsThe IRB 6700 family of robots is a natural evolution following 40 years of large robot heritage at ABB. This 7th generation of large ABB robots features a multitude of next generation improvements derived from intimate customer relationships and exhaustive engineering studies.The IRB 6700 family is the highest performance robots in the 150-300 kilogram class, now with a 20 percent reduction in total cost of ownership achieved through more robust design, longer service intervals, increased efficiency and simplified maintenance versus the previous generation.Multiple variantsThese robots enhances ABB’s portfolio by combining greater uptime, higher payloads and longer reach for use in Spot Welding, Material Handling and Machine Tending applications at the automotive and the general industries. This array of robot variants has payloads from 150 to 300 kg, reaches 2.6 to 3.2 meters, and are avalible as floor mounted and inverted versions.                Robust and reliableThe entire robot structure has been strengthened with higher rigidity, resulting in increased accuracy, shorter cycle time and better protection. It has been built to withstand the harshest working environments and is available with ABB’s ultimate Foundry Plus 2 protection system. The IRB 6700 has also been validated and tested with more robot prototypes than ever before to ensure that the predictions for reliability were accurate in the real world.                Simplified maintenanceIn designing the robot, easier serviceability was identified as a critical aspect for improving its total cost of ownership. Therefor service and repair time has been reduced by 15 percent.                Access to motors has also been improved and technical documentation for maintenance has become easier to read and understand through the use of improved graphics and 3D simulations called “Simstructions.”                Built around LeanIDEvery robot in the 6700 family has been designed to accommodate LeanID—a new Integrated Dressing (ID) solution meant to achieve a balance between cost and durability by integrating the most exposed parts of the dress pack into the robot. Equipping an IRB 6700 with LeanID makes it easier to program and simulate with predictable cable movements, creates a more compact footprint, and lengthens service intervals due to lessened wear and tear.                Features and benefits- Increased service intervals and decreased service times- Longer uptime—mean time between failures 400,000 hours- Available with Lean ID for cost effectively increasing dress pack lifetimes- More robust with a rigid structure and a new generation of motors and compact gearboxes- Increased speed and shorter cycle times—on average 5 percent faster- Improved accuracy and higher payloads- Built to operate in the harshest environments—available with Foundry Plus 2 package- 15 percent lower power consumption- The IRB 6700 family includes 10 variants, available as floor mounted and inverted versions.

			"0": "Expert for washing and cleaning in harsh environmentsThe market leading robot with lowest total cost of ownership in the most demanding washing and cleaning applications. It is designed for high reliability in harsh environments and reduces maintenance costs by up to 60%.                NOTE : The IRB 6790 will be available soon.                Supports applications in the toughest environmentsABB’s IRB 6790 Foundry Prime robot is designed for high-pressure water jet cleaning, washing and similar applications in harsh industrial environments with 100% humidity. Leveraging more than 13 years of industry experience, ABB developed its third-generation Foundry Prime robot aimed at increasing reliability and system uptime, while reducing maintenance costs.                The robot is available in two variants – one with a 205 kg payload with 2.80 m reach, and one with a 235 kg payload and 2.65 m reach.                Unrivalled flexibility for increased productivityThe IRB 6790’s high flexibility allows different part geometries to be cleaned in the same cell with zero changeover time. This supports mass customization for automotive manufacturers as well as original equipment manufacturers and their tier suppliers. In addition to increased flexibility and productivity, this solution provides faster speeds and on average a 5% shorter cycle time.                The robot design is focused on delivering reliability, improved system uptime, and optimized maintenance for convenient serviceability, which reduces the total cost of ownership by 60%.                 Enhanced protection from water and dustIP69-rated for protection from water and dust ingress, in addition the third-generation Foundry Prime robot provides enhanced protection from heat, cleaning pressure, chemicals, and dirt typically found in harsh and wet environments without the need for an additional complex protective covering.                 Because cleaning or washing processes are performed using detergents that can reach a pH level of 10, the Foundry Prime robot is built with a high chemical tolerance. Additionally, all external robot surfaces are either coated or in stainless steel to protect against corrosion. The Foundry Prime 3 can withstand 100% humidity and the water vapor of a typical cleaning application to ensure a long product lifecycle under aggressive cleaning operations.                 Key Features and Benefits- Stainless steel and plated surfaces to ensure corrosion protection- All movable sealing joints in stainless steel- Higher thermal and chemical resistance with durable Viton® seals- All electrical encapsulations, wrist and balancing unit pressurized and supervised- Cable glands made for wet environment- Compatible with pH levels of up to 10- Protection level IP 69 according to IEC 60529- All warning and instruction signs are etched to withstand the environment.

Characteristics such as high available torque and inertia capability, rigid design, and powerful acceleration have earned this market leader its “Power Robot” title.The IRB 7600 is ideal for heavy applications, regardless of industry. Typical uses include the handling of heavy fixtures and parts, turning car bodies, lifting engines, in foundries or forges, loading and unloading of machine cells. It can also be used to lift large, heavy pallet layers.                With all these applications the moment of inertia is very high which allows the IRB 7600 to handle heavy and wide parts.                SafeMove2A major challenge with robots handling payloads of up to 500 kg is ensuring the safety for personnel and protecting expensive equipment from the unlikely event of an accident. As a result, ABB has developed SafeMove2, a safety certified robot supervision solution that allows lean and flexible robotic systems without compromising safety. It includes a host of cutting-edge safety functions, including safe speed limits, safe standstill monitoring, safe axis ranges and position and orientation supervision.

With a focus on high production capacity, compact design, simple service, and low maintenance cost, the IRB 8700 offers a generalpurpose robot with the handling capacity and sustainability to meet even your heaviest demands.In designing the IRB 8700, ABB focused on delivering a reliable robot with a low total cost of ownership. Through a combination of robust design elements, including simpler parts configurations where possible, ABB Robotics applied decades of engineering experience to combine the high performance customers require with low overall maintenance needs. In addition, the IRB 8700 delivers 25% faster speeds than any other robot in this class size.Features and benefits- High payloads up to 1000 kg with the wrist down- 25% faster speeds than other robots in this size class- Highly reliable with simplified design and Foundry Plus 2 protection standard- Built around LeanID for reduced wear on dress packs and ease of simulation- Built using non-hazardous materials                Outstanding reliabilityWith a straightforward and uncomplicated design that uses world-class components, LeanID for the best cost-to-endurance ratio in a dress pack, and ABB’s Foundry Plus 2 as standard protection, the IRB 8700 will run with very high uptime—a key feature in production lines that operate around the clock.                Simplified designThe IRB 8700 has only one motor and one gear per robot axis, while most other robots in this size class use dual motors and/or gears. In addition, there are no gas springs that can leak and cause safety problems, only a reliable counterweight and mechanical springs for counter balancing. Together these design elements mean fewer components to fail while delivering shorter cycle times and higher accuracy.                Built around LeanIDWith LeanID, ABB has developed a concept that is less expensive than completely integrated dress packs but still delivers most of the benefits for a fraction of the cost. LeanID results in a robot that is easy to simulate in offline programming, has a long dress pack lifetime, supports flexible production with a large working range, and can easily enter tight spaces.                FastHigh payload robots are typically known as being very slow, but the IRB 8700 turns these assumptions on their head. With a compact footprint, optimized counterweight, parallel linkages, stiff axes, and fewer drive motors, the IRB 8700 keeps its momentum down and speed up. In fact, all of these improvements add up to a robot that is 25 % faster than any other robot in its size class. In addition, thanks to superior motion control at high moments of inertia (725 kgm2) the robot can adapt, or slow its speed, to accommodate heavy and wide parts.                SustainableThe IRB 8700 fully complies with environmental directive RoHS 2002/95/EC and Reach No1907/2006 directives for using non-hazardous materials, resulting in a robot that is safer for work environments.

In addition, the IRB 8700 delivers 25% faster speeds than any other robot in this class size.Features and benefits- High payloads up to 1000 kg with the wrist down- 25% faster speeds than other robots in this size class- Highly reliable with simplified design and Foundry Plus 2 protection standard- Built around LeanID for reduced wear on dress packs and ease of simulation- Built using non-hazardous materials                Outstanding reliabilityWith a straightforward and uncomplicated design that uses world-class components, LeanID for the best cost-to-endurance ratio in a dress pack, and ABB’s Foundry Plus 2 as standard protection, the IRB 8700 will run with very high uptime—a key feature in production lines that operate around the clock.                Simplified designThe IRB 8700 has only one motor and one gear per robot axis, while most other robots in this size class use dual motors and/or gears. In addition, there are no gas springs that can leak and cause safety problems, only a reliable counterweight and mechanical springs for counter balancing. Together these design elements mean fewer components to fail while delivering shorter cycle times and higher accuracy.                Built around LeanIDWith LeanID, ABB has developed a concept that is less expensive than completely integrated dress packs but still delivers most of the benefits for a fraction of the cost. LeanID results in a robot that is easy to simulate in offline programming, has a long dress pack lifetime, supports flexible production with a large working range, and can easily enter tight spaces.                FastHigh payload robots are typically known as being very slow, but the IRB 8700 turns these assumptions on their head. With a compact footprint, optimized counterweight, parallel linkages, stiff axes, and fewer drive motors, the IRB 8700 keeps its momentum down and speed up. In fact, all of these improvements add up to a robot that is 25 % faster than any other robot in its size class. In addition, thanks to superior motion control at high moments of inertia (725 kgm2) the robot can adapt, or slow its speed, to accommodate heavy and wide parts.                SustainableThe IRB 8700 fully complies with environmental directive RoHS 2002/95/EC and Reach No1907/2006 directives for using non-hazardous materials, resulting in a robot that is safer for work environments.

With a compact footprint, optimized counterweight, parallel linkages, stiff axes, and fewer drive motors, the IRB 8700 keeps its momentum down and speed up. In fact, all of these improvements add up to a robot that is 25 % faster than any other robot in its size class. In addition, thanks to superior motion control at high moments of inertia (725 kgm2) the robot can adapt, or slow its speed, to accommodate heavy and wide parts.

			"0": "IRB 5500-22/23FlexPainter - A new way of exterior painting.The IRB 5500 FlexPainter takes painting closer to perfection by integrating the paint application equipment. Combined with its large work area and high acceleration and painting speed, the result is the most efficient and flexible paint robot solution for basically any application.                Paint savingsOur compact and light-weight paint application components enable us to put vital paint regulation equipment, like the pumps, as close as 15 cm from the wrist. This reduces paint and solvent waste during color change significantly.                We have integrated the process equipment in the IRB 5500 FlexPainter in addition to the fully integrated  process control (hardware and software). The IRC5P is controlling both the paint process and the robot motion so you can enjoy substantial savings.                Powered by IPSThe “push-out” function integrated in the IPS system is one specific feature that enables a reduction of paint even further. The basic architecture of IPS is built on combining process control and motion control as one, this simplified the system set up and enables for real savings and process perfection.                Built for paintingStandard solutions accommodate color change valves for up to 32* colors with circulation, integrated in the process arm of the robot. Also two pumps, driven by integrated servo motors, 64 pilot valves, atomizer control with dual shape air and closed loop regulation, closed loop regulation of bell speed and high voltage control – all fully integrated. Solutions for both solvent- and water-borne paint are available. Please note that more is avalible on special request.                Less atomizers, higher flowABB’s high flow RB1000 atomizer family is specifically designed for the high acceleration and speed of the IRB 5500 FlexPainter. This unique combination significantly reduces the number of robots needed in a spray booth and provides superior performance and high finish quality.                Modular paint componentsTo integrate the process into the IRB 5500 FlexPainter, ABB has developed a series of light-weight, compact and modular paint application components. This includes color change valves, 2K mixers, air- and paint regulators and pumps. All components are designed for maximum flow.                Paint robot control systemIRC5P is a modern control system, specifically designed for the paint shop. With the IPS (Integrated Process System), the userfriendly Ex certified FlexPaint Pendant and RobView 5 it is a combination of standardized functions for the paint installation and to fit specific needs. This package includes standard applications for defining User screens, Program editing and Version control, and many more. RobView 5 can also be a components in a larger Cell control HMI, like ABB FlexUI or other.                New variants with IRB 5500-22 floor mounted and IRB 5500-23 clean-wall railThe unique design and configuration of the wall mounted FlexPainter IRB 5500-22 has created the largest and most flexible robot working envelope for any paint robot.                It takes two FlexPainter IRB 5500-22s to handle jobs that up until now have required four paint robots. The results are lower cost, both initially and in the long run, faster installation, high uptime and reliability.The FlexPainter IRB 5500-22 is specifically designed for ABB’s efficient FlexBell Cartridge System (CBS). The loss during color change is close to zero. It is the best solution for non-batch painting and multiple colors.                Benefits- Faster return on investment- Improved reliability of a complete automation system- Increased flexibility for new processes and new vehicle models- Reduced size and environmetal impact of robotic paint booths- Reduced required booth length and width for a robotic paint system- Reduced air handling volumes for ventilation- Reduced emissions from booth exhausts- Reduced machine programming efforts, in time and personnel requirements",

			"0": "Compact paint robot with integrated 7-axisIRB 5500-27 is a new variant of the innovative IRB 5500 robot family. Featuring integrated 7-axes that enable a wider working range and flexible installation positioning, IRB 5500-27 is capable of supporting both interior and exterior automotive painting, as well as other paint applications.Design for universal backup in moving line and enhanced solution in stop & go line, IRB 5500-27 offers the increased flexibility and reach to accommodate diverse automotive body sizes, which can potentially reduce the number of robots required on a paint line. This increased flexibility combined with the ability to adjust the robot’s installation position reduces cycle times.                Moreover, the integration of ABB’s dynamic model for controlling all axes reduces overall energy consumption, increases accuracy, and ensures fully synchronized and balanced robot motion.Paint savingsOur compact and light-weight paint application components enable us to put vital paint regulation equipment, like the pumps, as close as 15 cm from the wrist. This reduces paint and solvent waste during color change significantly.                We have integrated the process equipment in the IRB 5500 FlexPainter in addition to the fully integrated process control (hardware and software). The IRC5P is controlling both the paint process and the robot motion so you can enjoy substantial savings.                Powered by IPSThe “push-out” function integrated in the IPS system is one specific feature that enables a reduction of paint even further. The basic architecture of IPS is built on combining process control and motion control as one, this simplified the system set up and enables for real savings and process perfection.                Built for paintingStandard solutions accommodate color change valves for up to 32* colors with circulation, integrated in the process arm of the robot. Also, two pumps, driven by integrated servo motors, 64 pilot valves, atomizer control with dual shape air and closed loop regulation, closed loop regulation of bell speed and high voltage control – all fully integrated. Solutions for both solvent- and water-borne paint are available. Please note that more is available on special request.                Paint robot control systemIRC5P is a modern control system, specifically designed for the paint shop. With the IPS (Integrated Process System), the user friendly Ex certified FlexPaint Pendant and RobView 5 it is a combination of standardized functions for the paint installation and to fit specific needs. This package includes standard applications for defining User screens, Program editing and Version control, and many more. RobView 5 can also be components in a larger Cell control HMI, like ABB FlexUI or other.",

Compared to conventional hard automation, the IRB 360 offers much greater flexibility in a compact footprint while maintaining accuracy and high payloads.ABB’s IRB 360 family of robots, more commonly known as the FlexPicker, are capable of the fastest picking applications and have been optimized for packing applications. The robot has outstanding motion performance with the shortest cycle times, precision accuracy, and high payloads.                The IRB 360 family includes variants with payloads of 1 kg, 3 kg, 6 kg, and 8 kg and reaches of 1130 mm and 1600 mm—meaning there is an IRB 360 for almost every need.Featuring outstanding motion control, short cycle times, and precision accuracy, an IRB 360 can operate at very high speeds in anything from narrow to wide spaces with very tight tolerances. Every FlexPicker also benefits from a re-engineered tool flange which can accommodate larger grippers, allowing for efficient handling of flow wrapped products at high speeds from an indexing belt.                Food handling applicationsA stainless option for food handling applications is IP69K validated so that it can be washed down with industrial detergents and high pressure hot water. This variant is also designed with smooth and easy to rinse-off surfaces and lubricant free joints that are resistant to most corrosives.                Software and controlsSetting up an application becomes easy using PickMaster® software which has evolved into an invaluable help for integrators and users. It simplifies vision configuration and offers the application tools needed for efficient high speed picking.
